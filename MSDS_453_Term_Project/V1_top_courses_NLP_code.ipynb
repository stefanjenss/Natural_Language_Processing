    "1. **Compare TF-IDF vs Doc2Vec for feature extraction** \n",
    "    - Vectorize the reviews using both TF-IDF and Doc2Vec (gensim library).\n",
    "    - TF-IDF represents documents as a weighted vector of important words. Doc2Vec learns semantic vector representations of documents.\n",
    "    - Compare the two approaches qualitatively and quantitatively (e.g. in downstream clustering/classification tasks) to see which captures more meaningful information from the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare K-means clustering vs LDA for topic modeling**\n",
    "    - Apply K-means clustering and LDA on the vectorized reviews to discover latent topics/themes discussed \n",
    "    - K-means aims to partition the reviews into K clusters based on feature similarity. LDA is a probabilistic model that assigns topic distributions to documents.\n",
    "    - Evaluate the coherence and interpretability of the topics/clusters found by each method. Use metrics like silhouette score, perplexity, human judgment."
