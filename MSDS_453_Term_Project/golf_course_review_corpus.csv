1,Pine Valley,"Pine Valley, NJ",George Crump / Harry S. Colt,1918,PINE VALLEY GOLF CLUB - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev1_pine_valley_1,"There’s not much point trying to do a hole-by-hole guide to Pine Valley since others have done a much better job than I could do, for example, the majestic flyover from Golf Digest a couple of years ago. Drone photography can often flatter a golf course - but not in this case. While it’s a great piece of work, I’m still not sure it quite does justice to the real thing.

So, instead of trying to do a course guide, I have some observations on what it is like to play the course as a pretty average golfer (I’m a 12 handicapper) and then a few tips about what to expect more generally if you find yourself with a tee time.

The fairways are much wider than they look...
Every single drive has a forced carry and you can rarely see the landing area. That’s really quite intimidating! However, I hit a pretty average length - usually driving about 230 yards - and from the men’s tees I was able to carry them all without any real issues. When you get over the carry (which normally includes a lot of sand) you will normally find a generous fairway which you just couldn’t see from the tee. A few times we hit what felt like pretty significant hooks or slices only to find the ball safely on the short stuff, no problem.

This meant that the second time we played (lucky I know!) it was far less intimidating from the tee box as we knew what was coming.
The 18th at Pine Valley is wide enough seen from above, but you can’t see the width of the fairway from the tee

 …however, the approaches are devilish
Pretty much half of your approaches will require a carry to the green with anything short being punished, at times brutally. When you combine that with the significant elevation change, you will often find this makes for a very tough second-shot course. So you really need to listen to your caddie and commit to the shots. When I did that, I tended to find I would get over the trouble. Anything less than 100% and you are in for problems. Also, there is no disgrace in laying up to the par 4s and going in with a wedge in three rather than trying to be an unlikely hero from a distance.
Some spots in the sand can be tricky to get out of!

Sand, sand, everywhere - and always a bugger to get out of
When you do come up short you will, more often than not, find your ball in the sand. I say sand rather than bunker as it is more like a waste area and certainly doesn’t play like a traditional bunker,

The lies are often very tight, indeed sometimes - like at the ‘Devil’s Asshole’ bunker on the 10th - there is just no sand in it at all. This takes a lot of getting used and I suspect for some you never do. You will find all manner of challenges - sometimes in a hard baked trench, sometimes against a cliff face with no possibility of a shot. You can take many, many shots trying to get out and the ruling allowing you to take a drop out of a bunker for a 2 shot penalty could be a valuable one to remember. I can only imagine how it must be to play in a medal, with a card in your hand. Terrifying!

The greens are often massive, and always wicked
So you’ve made the green in regulation having hit the wide fairway and nailed your approach. All is good, right? Alas, no. These greens are often vast and there is a lot of movement, so getting down in 2 is often a challenge beyond anyone but the very best putter. Again, listen to your caddie and make sure you ask for reads on all putts. Even the shortest can move hard.

Always take your punishment
While the fairways are wide, it is unlikely you are going to hit them all (although the 75 year old member I played with only missed one in two rounds!). Pine Valley shares some characteristics with the Australian Sandbelt and there is very little rough on the course. The trees which frame many holes don’t come into play too much either. If you miss a fairway you are likely to go straight into the sand or scrub and find yourself often with a very wonky stance or gnarly lie. You will soon learn not to be greedy, not to try and be a hero, but just to put it back on the short stuff. I know that’s advice you will get on most courses but believe me, it is essential here.
The par 3 fifth at Pine Valley - just another amazing hole!

Two rounds are definitely better than 1!
I was lucky enough to play the course twice on the same trip and that really helped to elevate my enjoyment. The first time I was a little tight and intimidated, the next morning I had a much better idea of what was going on and scored pretty well. 31 points off the members’ tees was as much as I could have possibly hoped for, and while I left a few out there, I managed my way around the course pretty well knowing what I could and couldn’t do.

 It really is a thing of beauty
The course is a truly special place. Visually, it is stunning with the colours of the trees, sand and grasses making it look like a magnificent painting. Most holes are self contained, you don’t see others playing as you walk around, and there is no traffic to speak of. It is an incredibly peaceful and tranquil place. 

I hope that helps should you find yourself getting the call to play the course. However, Pine Valley is about more than just the course. 

TOUR TIPS
The entrance to Pine Valley
So, the invite has come and you are all set for Pine Valley. What’s the on-property etiquette and how expensive is the wine I hear you ask? Fear not, read on…

Getting to Pine Valley
You’ve probably read a little about the arrival at the property. Apparently it used to be quite a feat finding the little turn off for Pine Valley but Google Maps has changed all that. Still, it is fun turning past the Clementon Amusement  Park, through a very ordinary looking conurbation, but safe in the knowledge you are just minutes away from possibly the finest golf course in the world!

On arrival, staff at the guardhouse will check that you are on the list and your member is awaiting you. It’s all very discreet but it’s quite clear, if you’re not on the list, you’re not getting in. Pine Valley is large property, so savour the drive in. And to whet the appetite, you’ll actually cross the 18th hole as you reach the clubhouse.

Accommodation at Pine Valley
Hopefully your invite to play at Pine Valley will come with a request to stay the night on the property too. You can only play the course if you are accompanied by a member. The only exception to this is if your member is too infirm to play but has maintained his membership. Either way, your member needs to be on site at all times. Not only that, but expect him to stay close by your side. It’s all done in a very friendly way, but it’s not an accident when he meets you outside your room in the morning not in the breakfast hall!

There are three main types of accommodation at Pine Valley. Firstly, the lodge, which is just next to the clubhouse with one side looking over the fourth fairway and green and the other side facing up the par 3 fifth. The lodge comprises a couple of dozen bedrooms – each with a double bed, cable TV and comfortable shower. The rooms are probably a solid four star hotel standard, so a step up from some on site golf accommodation. The showers were very good, the beds comfy and you could leave your shoes outside your door to be cleaned overnight! Oh, and there are no locks on the doors here, inside or out. They’re a very trusting lot at Pine Valley!

Next door is the dormitory. Accommodation is a little more basic here, including communal showers. Still, if that is the price to pay to be a minute’s walk from the first tee at Pine Valley then so be it!

Members also use many of the private houses scattered all over this vast property so you may well find yourself staying the night tucked behind any green or tee, which would be a pretty nice view to wake up to.

Learn the secret code
There is clearly an etiquette here that members introduce themselves to anyone that they see. The secret to knowing whether you’re talking to a member or another guest is that members will have the Pine Valley logo on their hat/shirt/top without the words ‘Pine Valley’. This ‘no script’ apparel marks them out as one of the chosen ones. Be prepared to do a lot of smiling and introducing!

The clubhouse
The clubhouse itself at Pine Valley is a modest affair. Think antiquated charm rather than modern bling! The locker rooms are functional rather than fancy and the bar is short but well stocked. The vibe is that this is a club for proper golfers. There’s no Country Club atmosphere here – people are here for the golf.

While the main purpose of the clubhouse is functional, there are displays of hickories from days gone by, including several Tom Morris clubs, as well as many fine portraits and trophies adorning the walls so do make sure you get some time to dwell and take it all in.

Eating at Pine Valley
The restaurant is neither large nor overly formal, but the staff will make you feel very welcome and there’s no need to stand on ceremony. For lunch we had the turtle snapper soup and a sandwich – a Pine Valley classic. The sherry was passed around to put in the soup and it was actually very pleasant. You’re fine with soft spikes in the clubhouse and everyone is in golf gear during the day. No Muirfield-style dressing for lunch here.

Dress in the evening time is smarter, the members will have their green jackets on and it’s blazers, ties and slacks all round. We were there in September and the place was jumping. In fact I heard one of the members saying that it was proving hard to get another time in that season, so busy was the course and accommodation. The food is good quality - don’t expect quite Michelin fare and you’ll be fine - and the wine list is extensive but reasonably priced.

This isn’t a place where you should expect a lock-in until the early hours (although I’m sure it happens occasionally!). By 10:30pm it was thinning out and most were off to their beds.

Breakfast the next morning was good too - plenty of fruit, cereal, possibly the best bacon I’ve ever had and an egg station. All excellent!

Hitting the range
The driving range at Pine Valley is one of the very best around, as you’d imagine. It’s a little way from the clubhouse and first tee so you’ll probably get a lift from one of the staff who will arrange a time to come and get you back too. There are plenty of Pro V1s and you’ll be hitting to greens with precise yardages from every hitting spot – you don’t see that every day. There’s also a good short game area. For putting, there’s a green right next to the 18th green and 1st tee box. Plenty of time to build up the anticipation before hitting what may be the most nerve-wracking first drive of your life (oh, and no mulligans!!)

The scorecard at the short course at Pine Valley

Time for 10 more?
While there’s no doubt that Pine Valley is a mentally and physically demanding course, it would be a real shame to play here and not visit the 10-hole Tom Fazio creation that opened in 1992. 8 of the 10 holes are exact replicas of approach shots you will find on the course (at 2, 3, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18) and there are a further 2 original creations. The hitting area on the holes will be moved anywhere between 327 and 86 yards so you get a good test of different approaches. When we played they seemed mainly to be over 170 yards, so it was no push over. In fact, without the caddies and the vegetation grown up a bit more, the balls were actually harder to find. Amazingly the holes really do look and feel like the originals – the elevation change is the same, as is the direction, so you get a really authentic experience.

The pro shop
OK, so that’s all well and good, but we know what you’re really here for. It’s all about the swag of course. You will be glad to know there is a very well stocked pro shop in the clubhouse. I was slightly nervous here since I didn’t want to look like a Bag-Tag-Barry but equally I was keen not to let this moment pass without a few memories for me. And my friends. And my family. And anyone else who knows me.

Rather intimidatingly there are no prices on anything so you need to use some care as you are piling up your purchases but the costs aren’t any higher than you would expect to see at any other shop of its ilk. Also, unlike at some private clubs in the US you don’t have to put these purchases on your host’s account - they will happily take your credit card. I suspect they have seen it all here, so don’t be shy about buying all you want!

But what about the Bag Tag?
Every guest is given a bag tag that one of the guys there will attach to your bag with a set of pliers. I am in two minds about whether it’s a nice touch or a bit ‘show-offy’ move, but the tag is still on my bag while I decide!
Pine Valley Bag Tag
So there you have it, the whole experience at Pine Valley is tremendous and I hope this has given you a little taste of what to expect if you get the invite! As for where else to play if you’re in the area, it would clearly be worth the trip just to play Pine Valley but the perfect doubler would be Merion, just an hour away. My only advice would be try to play Merion first so you can save the best until last!"
2,Pine Valley,"Pine Valley, NJ",George Crump / Harry S. Colt,1918,"Pine Valley Golf Club (Clementon, New Jersey)",Bill Satterfield,rev2_pine_valley_2,"What to Expect:  Pine Valley is the finest golf course on the planet. It holds the royal flush of attributes: variety, memorability, tradition, difficulty, and pristine conditions. Plenty of courses want to claim they have 18 signature holes, but Pine Valley can make a stronger argument for that title than any other course in the world. It is hard to imagine that a course of Pine Valley's caliber could be better than it is hyped up to be; but it is. Our friend and host, a longtime Pine Valley member, had this to say, ""Pine Valley is underrated as the #1 course in the world."" Pine Valley is so good it is in a league of its own. The walking-only course is set on nearly 200 acres of sandy terrain that features tons of pine trees and marvelous elevation changes. Though often classified as a penal course, the fairway widths are quite generous and the green complexes are spectacular. Identifying the best hole on the course is like trying to pick your favorite child; it is nearly impossible because they are all so good for different reasons. The world class driving range, about a mile from the clubhouse, features precise yardages from each bag stand to each flag in the field so there is no excuses for not being ""dialed in"" before your round. Lastly, the caddies are all dressed in white, which is a further indication that Pine Valley may actually be heaven on earth!

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  Honestly, how can you just pick one?! In fact, it might be easier to try and identify a hole that wouldn't be considered the signature hole . . . maybe. Never has this category seemed so futile then when trying to write a review on Pine Valley. Pine Valley really deserves a hole-by-hole review, but since that isn't the format I use I'll simply include photos of a couple of the holes I loved that aren't featured in the rest of the review.

Best Par 3:  5th Hole – 238 Yards – Ranked in 1999 among Golf Digest's 99 Greatest Holes in America, the 5th hole at Pine Valley is one of the finest and most difficult one-shotters you'll come across. The tee box to the fifth hole rests behind the clubhouse and travels a totally different direction than the previous par three. Playing uphill from tee to green, your tee shot must carry a water hazard just beyond the tee box before also needing to carry the cross bunker. Most tee shots will come up short and find a portion of the fairway resting in front of the green while tee shots that leak right will find themselves in a deep bunker pinned up next to the trees. This is a very heroic hole where pars should be celebrated like birdies!

5th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (238 Yard Par 3)

Best Par 4:  13th Hole – 486 Yards – Bobby Jones referenced this hole as the greatest par four in the world, and I'm not going to argue. It only ranked behind the 8th at Pebble Beach and 17th at Cypress Point on Golf Digest's list of greatest par 4s in America. The tee box to this hole is tucked back into the tree and affords the golfer only a slivers view of the uphill fairway. After placing your tee shot in the fairway, the golfer is treated to a view of the green and watches the hole unfold as the fairway bottlenecks and then turns left before widening and pushing back the deep waste areas running along the fairway edges. From most tee shots, the straightest line to the green requires challenging the bunkers up the left side of the hole while a large landing area to the right is afforded to golfers not feeling quite as bold. The 13th at Pine Valley is a wonderful challenge that delivers options and excitement every loop you make.

13th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (486 Yard Par 4)

Best Par 5:  15th Hole – 615 Yards – After completing two exceptional holes in the par four 13th and par three 14th, the golfer is handed a treat with the par five 15th which is one of only two such par rated holes on the course. While at some courses the par fives are looked at as a chance to feel some reprieve and score low, it is quite the opposite at Pine Valley. The 15th hole demands a tee shot that will carry the large water hazard off the tee before coming to rest on the left-to-right sloping fairway. Plenty of fairway width is afforded to the golfer initially, but closes down and runs uphill more and more as the green is approached. At 615 yards the hole is long by anyone's standard, but the steady climb uphill makes the hole feel and play even longer and can mentally overcome a golfer that isn't prepared for the challenge. It is a wonderful hole and a fitting challenge for a course of Pine Valley's caliber.

15th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (615 Yard Par 5)

Birdie Time:  10th Hole – 161 Yard Par 3 – The shortest hole on the course isn't short on accolades or impressive features; however it does deliver the best opportunity to score a birdie. The green creates an inland island surrounded by sand and hosts one of the smaller putting surface at the course. The distance is such that dead aim can be taken at most pin locations, but properly guiding your ball into the hole on the sloped putting surface is where the real challenge lies here. With so many challenges at Pine Valley, this is your chance to try and take a stroke back from old man par.

10th Hole at Pine Valley Golf Club (161 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  7th Hole – 636 Yard Par 5 – The 7th hole boasts one of the largest and most famous interior hazards in all of golf; the notorious Hell's Half Acre bunker. Spanning the entire width of the fairway, the bunker contains natural foliage and runs nearly 100 yards in length, epitomizing Sahara style bunkering. At 636 yards, bogey is already something most golfers will have to concede a bogey on. But with Hell's Half Acre bunker in the middle of the hole, tee balls that don't find the fairway will be forced to punch out short of the bunker before proceeding over. For those not willing to let Hell's Half Acre intimidate them, there is the option of taking your chances on what kind of lie you will get in the heavily travelled sand, but scores rarely finish low with that strategy. Even though this hole encompasses the flattest terrain on the property, there are a myriad of challenges awaiting the golfer that can't hit the ball high and straight."
3,Cypress Point,"Pebble Beach, CA",Alister MacKenzie,1928,Cypress Point,top100golfcourses,rev3_cypress_point_1,"Every true golfer would love to play Cypress Point, but the reality of the matter is that unless you are in the know, only a lucky few will ever get the chance to tee it up on the 1st. Folklore has it that J.F. Kennedy was once refused entry to the restaurant and, with only 250 members, mere mortals find it hard to get a game.

Cypress Point Club is set at the foothills of the Santa Lucia Mountains on the very tip of the Monterey Peninsula and the cliff top terrain is varied and thrilling. Almost as many superlatives have been used to describe the beauty of the location as the course itself.

Masa Nishijima, co-author of Tom Doak’s Confidential Guide to Golf Courses, commented as follows: “Seth Raynor was under contract to do the course, but Raynor passed away in 1926 before the start of construction, and Robert Hunter managed to convince the client to let Dr. MacKenzie have a look at the course when he made his first visit to California later that year.”

“The best 17-hole course in the world” is how Cypress Point has been described. The closing hole is considered by some to be little more than a route back to the clubhouse and perhaps the 16th hole is a weakness too, especially if you can’t carry the ball more than 200 yards into the prevailing wind. The Pacific is the ultimate water hazard on this 231-yard one-shot hole. It’s considered the best golf hole in the world or the worst if you dump your third tee shot into the sea.

David commented on our Cypress Point article. We feel his points are valid and worthy of sharing:

“While most of your course intros seem ok, this one is really off. It was one guy, Jimmy Demaret that called Cypress Point the best 17-hole course he's ever played. He was a great pro, but not an expert in golf course architecture by any means. Granted the 18th might be a little strange, but it's a great hole in its own right. At most courses maybe even their signature hole. A blind tee shot over Cypress Trees to a narrow fairway the dog legs steep up a hill to a green sloping form back to front with a huge cypress tree blocking out the entire left side of the green requiring a perfect drive to have a chance at the green with a shaped approach from an uneven lie. Land it too deep above the hole and you’re faced with a treacherous putt, miss right while shaping your shot and you are in one of the bunkers guarding the green. Does that sound at all like a weak hole?

Also the 16th is not properly described. In typical MacKenzie fashion this hole can be played many ways. He always leaves a way for weaker golfers. The 16th is no different. If the carry is impossible for your ability level you can play left requiring a carry of around or less than 100 yards to a partially hidden fairway and play this hole as a par 4. Any level can do this. I watched a 92 year old man par the hole with no problem in that fashion. So I'd argue this is not my opinion even, it's just plain fact which makes the intro you have incorrect and a bit unfair to Cypress Point and to MacKenzie.”"

The course is so special, so magical, and so beautiful that it is difficult to portray the experience in writing. The club at Cypress Point delves deep to the roots of golf where players must walk their round, be accompanied by a club-carrying caddy, and rely on their caddy for distances since there are no yardage markers on the course. Gentlemen must wear a collard shirt and slacks while changing your shoes anywhere but in the locker room is stricly prohibited. Dr. Alister MacKenzie's work has set the standard by which golf course architecture is measured and the experience is second to none. If your hoping to join the club, you better track the obituaries because memberships don't open up at Cypress Point until someone dies - it's that special.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 222 Yard Par 3 – This is one of the most famous and best holes on the known earth. Featuring the most exhilarating tee shot in golf, over 200 yards is required to carry the Pacific Ocean to a peninsula green framed by bunkers, rocks, and ice plant. A fairway left of the green is afforded as on option off the tee in the event the incoming winds are blowing too strong or if you just aren't feeling confident enough with your hybrid/fairway wood to fire straight at the green. The pinnacle of your golfing existence is reached on this tee box the first time you step on it.

16th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (222 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  15th Hole – 135 Yards – Since the mind blowing 16th has already been featured as the signature hole, a review of Cypress Point wouldn't be complete without mention of the 16th's prettier and more playable little brother, the 15th. Playing just 135 yards, the stunningly beautiful 15th hole is surrounded by bunkers, oceans rocks, and cypress trees and offers the best chance for birdie of all the par threes. This hole represents the first of back-to-back par threes and the first hole of the best three hole stretch in all of golf.

15th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (135 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  17th Hole – 386 Yards – This is simply one of the prettiest tee shots for a par four in all of golf. With the tee box sitting directly behind the 16th green on a peninsula jetting out into the Pacific, your tee shot gets blasted over the rocky coast to a landing area where a cluster of cypress trees await to cause havoc on your approach shot. The green slides back out toward the ocean and is surrounded by brilliant white sand bunkers and naturally jagged ocean rocks. The worst part of #17 is the feeling you get after holing out when you realize that you are only one hole away from having having to walk off perhaps the greatest course known to man.

17th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (386 Yard Par 4)

Best Par 5:  6th Hole – 521 Yards – I hope I don't get struck down for blasphemy by saying Cypress Point has a weak point, but clearly the par 5s at the course can't even begin to compete with the quality and drama the par 3s and 4s offer. The second of back-to-back par 5s, the sixth hole plays downhill with a fairway that slopes hard from right to left. With the portion of the fairway you want your tee shot to land out of sight from the tee box, a powerful draw will make this hole very reachable in two to one of the best green sites on the course. Classic MacKenzie bunkers surround the green site and beg the golfer to play it safe to the right side of the green and work the ball back toward the hole.

6th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (521 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  9th Hole – 289 Yard Par 4 – One of the great short par fours in the world, the concluding hole of the outward nine is a sub-300 yarder that should get the adrenaline pumping. When the pin is in the lower tier on the right side of the green it begs long hitters to take out their driver and go for the heroic shot towards the flag. However, when perched in the upper left side of the green, sand fronts the entire putting surface on that line and cautions players from being too aggressive with their tee shot and to instead play to the fat portion of the fairway 50 yards shy of the center of the green. In match play, this is truly one of the best offerings to look forward to while looping around Cypress Point.

9th Hole at Cypress Point Golf Club (289 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  16th Hole – 222 Yard Par 3 – On the scorecard the 16th hole is identified as the #6 handicap. Trust me, not only does Cypress Point lack five holes that are more difficult, but there are few holes anywhere that are going to average more strokes over par than the par three 16th. Requiring a forced carry of 200 yards over the Pacific Ocean, many tee shots find a watery grave never to be heard from again. In fact, on a windy day it is not uncommon to see smart golfers play a 9 iron to the fairway left of the green followed up by a 9 iron into the green. Anytime laying up on a par three can be deemed an intelligent move even for scratch golfers, you know you've stepped onto one of the most difficult holes you'll ever have the pleasure of playing.

"
5,Shinnecock Hills,"Southampton, NY",William Flynn,1931,Review: Shinnecock Hills Golf Club,Andrew Harvey,rev5_shinnecock_1,"There’s not many courses as acclaimed, sought after or documented as Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Originally built in the late 1800’s by Willie Davis, with Willy Dunn updating the course a couple years after it opened, C.B. Macdonald with Seth Raynor updating the layout in 1916, and finally, William Flynn, his partner Howard Toomey, and foreman Dick Wilson coming in 1931 to construct basically a new layout.

The design credit is given to William Flynn. The Macdonald golf course is gone, although the land where the current 3rd, 6th and 7th are remain fairly close to Macdonald’s Shinnecock Hills. Aside from the background, most people are aware of the championship pedigree of ‘Shinne’ and how notoriously difficult it is. It’s also well-known Shinnecock is one of the best in the world.

Shinnecock is one of the most difficult courses in the world, but it opens on a fairly gentle note. “Westwood Ho” is a 391 yard par 4 playing downhill into the bottom of the property.


Driver or three wood are fine off the tee for most. It’s not overly long and a nice introduction into the golf course.

However, the “gentle handshake” opener is really only on the opening tee shot. The green complexes here are so nasty and aggressive that there’s not a moment on this golf course you can walk through an approach shot. Ask Tiger Woods–he hit it over the green here in the 2018 US Open one round and made 7!


With a false front and a fall off over the back, it’s a difficult iron shot. For those who have played Pinehurst No. 2, the first green complex is similar at No. 2 as it is here, except Shinnecock’s is maybe three times as extreme.


The second hole is a long par 3 at 221 yards. “Plateau” is aptly named, with a green pushed up. A false front kicks balls to the right, while bunkering flanks the left side. Once again, the back edge falls off. The US Open tee here is 250 or so yards–insanity!


The third is another difficult hole at 470 yards, par 4. “Peconic,” named after the Peconic Bay that Shinnecock sits near (and National Golf Links of America sits on), is one of the more appealing tee shots on the golf course.


I don’t remember the exact carry on the bunkers left, but if you’re a bigger hitter, it’s best to fly those. Leaving it out to the right leaves quite a long shot into this green, and that’s something you don’t want.

One of the more benign greens at Shinne, if such a thing. It’s only partly raised up. Thankfully, it accepts low, running shots fairly easily (something most will have here).


After the long, dogleg left, a middle length par 4 swinging to the right awaits at the 4th. “Pump House” plays 409 yards with bunkering on the inside corner of the dogleg.


Flynn’s biggest strength, in my opinion, is taking basic architecture principals and flipping them on their head, and there’s potentially no better example than here. On the 4th, bunkering guards the inside corner. Basic architecture knowledge and strategy understanding would suggest keeping it closer to the inside corner, but the opposite is true. Flynn’s green contouring often dictate play, and here, the best play is to hit it to the outside corner for the best angle in.


The 5th is the first par 5 on the golf course. It’s probably a good idea to play this hole well–there’s only two 5’s!

“Montauk” is a brilliant 535 yard golf hole split in the middle by a sandy hollow covered in heather. Keeping it to the right lets the shorter hitters easier, while the left side is a bigger carry. Either side, you gotta make sure you pick your line properly!


As you can see, the front nine at Shinnecock, for the most part, is pretty flat. The land doesn’t seem too inspiring. However, upon further inspection, you see micro-undulations and little bumps that can make it incredibly difficult to hit the shots you need to. The 5th is a great example.

As you can see from the photo below, I picked the right fairway. It was a cold October morning!


The green on the 5th is insanity, with fall offs everywhere. We had a back right pin, and to our surprise, anything long or right is the wrong miss!


You can see that over the 5th green is not the best spot to me.


The 6th is a pretty difficult hole in general, but picking your line here is a difficult task with the sea of heather and sand in front of you. 456 yards, “pond” is not easy.


The namesake comes along on the approach. Unless you missed the fairway, the pond will almost never come into play. It’s some 50 yards short of the green–well out of play.


This is another great, dare I say all-world green complex. I won’t say too much, but hopefully my photo below allows you to see the genius of the shaping here!


The 7th is likely the most famous hole here. In the 2004 US Open, the USGA lost control of the golf course, and the 7th, “Redan”, was the main issue. They were watering the green in between groups because balls wouldn’t stay on the green! That’s how severe this slope is.

But anyways, as we stepped up, our caddy told us “Redan” is french for double bogey, or something. At 189 yards, you wouldn’t expect double bogeys to come as easy as they do here! But I wouldn’t know, I made 2 (yes, this is a brag–please DM Thegolfingcanuck on Instagram about it).


In terms of the “redan” template, I don’t know if this is the best rendition. Actually, I think many people turn to next door at National Golf Links of America as a good example. The biggest issue with calling this “redan” is the ground game isn’t really encouraged like all the best redans. Typically, the best redans allow the bail out short right to let the natural movement of the land guide the ball in. However, here, that’s not happening as anything short collects at the bottom.


So that leaves you flying the shot onto the green, which is impossible. There’s only about a 7 x 7 square of area on the front portion of the green you can land it on that it will stay on the green. I wish I would’ve hit mine better to see, but the tilt on this is pure madness. Take a look below.


What’s even crazier is this might be the easiest par 3 here!

This is the best advice I will ever give. If you have a birdie in you, consider making it on the 8th hole. At 394 yards, it’s one of the shorter par 4’s at Shinne.


It still requires quite a good short iron in, but it’s the flattest hole here (wonderfully named “lowlands”). A massive false front and after that it runs hard to the back is all you need to negotiate with.


I say made a birdie on 8 because you’re now into a difficult three hole stretch. Upon writing this, the 9th, “Ben Nevis”, starts the best three hole stretch I’ve seen.


A 438 yard par 4, this hole moves to the left working back up to the base of the clubhouse. You start getting into much more undulating topography as well, giving a ton of wonky lies in the fairway.

With a long or mid iron in (you will have more club in that you’d think for a 440 par 4), it is as intimidating as anything. Playing up to the top, you have to hoist a club up to have any chance.


Thankfully, the green bowls in from the right. If you need to miss one, miss it right or long, but not too right as it’ll be in the mens locker room.


But don’t miss short.


To get a sense of the scale here, below is the view of the 9th green from the 18th.


The 9th is a great hole, but my vote for the best hole at Shinnecock is the 415 yard par 4, 10th “Eastward Ho.” Playing over the topography, it’s a blind tee shot.


The land is incredibly severe over the ridge that you will almost definitely have a messed up stance. Compounding that with the shot that awaits, it becomes an incredible approach shot. This is in my upper tier of favorite holes ever.


With the green site cut on the other side of the depression, anything short runs back about 60 yards. Below is a view from where each ball would collect (thankfully, I didn’t hit it here).


Anything long isn’t much better either, but at least you’re chipping back into the upslope (oh yeah, this green runs away from you at about 3% or 4%).


Looking back, you can see the roller coaster topography that lies in the fairway. It’s a rare hole where you can’t overpower it. With driver, you likely will have an awkward flip wedge in because the ball would run down forever. With restraint off the tee, you have a full club in (a good thing).


To finish off the all-world three hole stretch, we arrive at what has been dubbed the “shortest par 5 in golf.” In reality, “Hill Head,” the 159 yard par 3, 11th, is just an incredibly difficult par 3 up the hill.


It’s like hitting onto a tabletop. There’s very little square footage here.


Anything long and left is absolutely dead chipping back downhill. This is where I hit it, but I made a “birdie” 4 on this par 5 (doesn’t count? Really?). I was happy with a 4 here after missing it in the one spot you have to avoid.

The 12th is another excellent hole. In reality, there’s not a weak hole here (obviously). The back, however, continues to deliver all-world after all-world holes. 469 yards, “Tuckahoe” plays over Tuckahoe Road.


Shinnecock isn’t exactly the most difficult driving course in the world. As you can see, there’s a fair amount of width out here. The green complexes hold up extremely well, and the 12th is again difficult. In similar fashion to the 3rd, it rises ever-so-slightly and then falls back away from the player, but there’s ample room to hit a long iron in here.


The 13th is the shortest par 4 on the course at 374 yards. The hole moves pretty hard to the right around bunkering, but again, keeping it out to the outside corner on the left allows you to be hitting shots directly into the slope to control where the ball ends up as much as possible.


For those who remember, this is the hole where Phil Mickelson decided to hit a moving ball before it rolled down the mega false front.


The 14th, “Thoms Elbow,” is another great–no, all world–hole. 463 yards, it plays through some wonderful rolling land.


The approach shot plays uphill to a green that moves to the middle. It’s one of the rare holes here–with 9–that collects shots instead of repelling them.


A closer look at the green complex. It’s almost a saddle style green, with the two outside pin positions are higher than the middle portion.


The 15th is another wonderful mid length par 4. Playing down into the valley the front nine mainly occupied, it’s a good tee shot to let one go.


No doubt, it’s a well guarded green complex. Another one that runs away from you, it’s a rare forced golf shot that needs to be played high in the air. The beauty of Shinnecock is yes, the greens run away from you, but you’re often thinking of finding the false front to bump it into. You’re really not thinking about the aerial game outside of 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15. Everything else I found myself flighting shots in.


The 16th makes the trek back towards the clubhouse. The second par 5 on the golf course, “Shinnecock” is a 540 yard three shotter.


After you get the ball in play off the tee, the layup can be quite difficult. There’s quite a few bunkers on this hole alone, so navigating them is a challenge.


The green complex is pitched hard off the left, naturally falling to the low point of the property (3 fairway) and away from the high portion (11 green/12 tee). It is a splendid par 5.


The 17th is the final par 3 on the course at 180 yards. Interestingly titled “Eden,” this plays nothing like an eden template.


Ironically, it almost plays as a redan, with the green moving down and to the left. I don’t think it is, but it’s much closer to a redan than an eden! You can get a grasp of the green complex below.


The 18th is another outstanding, difficult par 4. Doglegging to the left, like 9, it avoids the cliche uphill par 4 finisher at the base of the clubhouse.


For the big hitters, the line is just to left of the caddies over the bunker. For the shorter hitters, playing out right is the play. With some undulating topography yet again complicating things, it’s a tough finisher at 426 yards. A bunker left, two short, and one right await players. The green complex has some of the wackiest, wild, and unpredictable movement anywhere. It makes for a ton of fun. If that pin is back-left, you’d have to hit it out right. If it’s on the right side, cutting the corner is the play. A wonderful hole to end.


Hard to say anything new about Shinnecock, but it blew my expectations away still. The beauty of Flynn’s architecture here is it’s a model you could adapt. Fallaway greens are rare in modern architecture, yet they shouldn’t be. They remain entirely playable, while being difficult enough to challenge the worlds best. Shinnecock Hills is a wonderful case study on how difficult short grass and angles can be.

Is it the worlds best? Hard to say so early. The only course I’ve played that would be close to Shinne in quality is Merion Golf Club’s East course. If someone told me the best course in the world was Shinnecock Hills, I would be able to see it fairly easily. An absolute bucket list course that I’ll be dreaming about throughout social distancing! (this last sentence will age well)."
6,Shinnecock Hills,"Southampton, NY",William Flynn,1931,SHINNECOCK HILLS GOLF CLUB - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev6_shinnecock_2,"Shinnecock Hills may just be the best golf course I’ve ever played. When you are playing a top 10 course in the world expectations are generally pretty high and there can be a little something which just makes you question how close to perfection it really is. Royal County Down had too many blind shots for me, National Golf Links was maybe a little too quirky. No such worries at Shinnecock – this was simply amazing on pretty much every level.

The course is hosting the US Open in 2018 and they have been doing a huge amount of work to prepare for it.  We played in September 2016 and the fairways had been sanded, according to our caddies this was pretty much business as usual at the moment – they are trying to get the course playing faster than ever in 2018. Sand was being injected into the fairways on a regular basis to get the course running firm and fast.

Coore and Crenshaw have been working on the course and they had also widened the fairways, there really wasn’t a huge amount of intimidation from the tees, and increased the greens by around 30%. This doesn’t actually increase the ‘playable’ area of the greens as the false fronts and run offs are significant but visually it is stunning. Since then we know some of the fairways have been tightened as the USGA worry about the course being over-run but hopefully that hasn't changed things too much.

The club itself is one of the oldest and most prestigious in the world, and it knows it! The welcome we received was pleasant enough but quite formal and this is a place which is serious about its golf. There is no sense that you are a ‘member for a day’ a la North Berwick. Oh no, you are honoured to be getting the chance to tee it up here. It’s well worth making sure you spend some time in the clubhouse looking at the letters and artefacts on the walls. 

While the inside of this clubhouse is great it’s actually the outside which has the real wow factor. It is said to be the oldest clubhouse in the USA and has a real simplicity to the design, perched on a hill and you can see through from one side through to the other.

The driving range is right up there with the best and there are plenty of opportunities to blow your money in the well-stocked pro shop, again though the welcome was cordial rather than effusive. The locker room is fairly straightforward but there are some nice touches. The membership list is up on the notice board with handicaps of all the members and there are some pretty illustrious names posted.

So we made our way to the first tee with two caddies in toe, one of whom had been working at the club for over 30 years and caddied for Bill Clinton, Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus here over the years so safe to say we were in good hands. 

We played from the medal tees where it’s a par 70 and the course measured just over 6,300 yards. Given the run on the ball and the width of the fairways it didn’t feel that this was a course you needed to try to overpower and while the longer hitters in the group had some advantage it was playable for all. The tees were really cleverly placed for us because it felt like we were playing the same approach shots in that the pros will in many cases without having to pound it 300+ from the tee.

However, we saw some of the new tees they were putting in for the US Open and they are going to take this course back a long way. It’ll be interesting to see just how long the course will measure then but given the fast running fairways it's understandably I think on balance that they have had to tighten it up in some areas as they need to do something to defend it, beyond the devilish greens.

There has been quite a lot of work done over recent years to bring in the current ‘in’ look on golf courses. You know the type - waste areas, natural edges to green, tee boxes which seem to just be plonked down on the ground. Coore and Crenshaw have been allowed to work their magic in places and it really does look fantastic.

I’m not going to go through a hole by hole analysis of the course but I would strongly urge you to look at this post on GolfClubatlas.com if that is what you are looking for. It is a fantastic description of the course.
Shinnecock Hills Golf COurse
What I will say is that this is a course which has no weak hole. Every single one gives adds to the experience of the course. This is definitely a course that is ‘all before you’. On almost every tee box you can see what is ahead, often from a slightly elevated position. There are a lot of doglegs, with more left to right, although as a drawer of the ball I didn’t feel unduly penalised.

The course most definitely has a proper links feel to it – the ball runs fast and the greens are hard to hold and often exposed to the wind. However, you cannot run the ball up to the greens in many cases as you could at a traditional British links. This is one of the main things that I found about US ‘links-style’ courses, they played harder than their UK counterparts often for this very reason.

The two nines both return to the wonderful clubhouse but this isn’t the kind of place where you pause for too much thought at the turn, given the fun you will could having you won’t really want to. The 10th is the only blind tee shot on the course before the brilliant short 11th greets you. Famed from the exploits of the 2004 US Open this really is a tough, tough par 3. Your caddie will mention more than once that it is the shortest par 5 in the world and my scorecard would support that view!

This is a course that you just don’t want to end, and when you walk off you will know that you have just enjoyed something very special. But it is playable - this isn’t a course which will chew you up and spit you out. Sure it’s a challenge and you will find it hard to play to your handicap but there doesn’t need to be any fear on the 1st tee box - at least not from the tees we played from with little wind and greens that hadn’t been mown to the quick. I guess 2018 will show us just what a test this will give to the best in the world, but I suspect they will find this course at its peak and the reports will be nothing short of adulatory. It definitely deserves it.

BOOKING THE COURSE
Shinnecock Hills sorecard
Sigh. I’m sorry but these American courses do make it very hard. At Shinnecock though there are a few glimmers. They do accept unaccompanied guest play if you can find a member to introduce you - Pine Valley and Merion for example don’t so this makes it marginally easier to get on - however you do need to find that member and there aren’t that many of them. Therefore, if you are really keen to get on then the best route may well be to look out for charity auctions again. In the last few months I have seen 2 or 3 on Charitybuzz.com and if you set up a Google alert service you should get to find out whenever something is available. They are few and far between though and it may set you into the thousands of dollars which is a lot to pay for a round of golf, even on one of the very best courses in the world.

TOUR TIPS

I have been to this part of the world a couple of times for golf and both times stayed in the town of Riverhead - about 20 minutes from Shinnecock Hills. We stayed in the Indigo hotel the first time - just a little out of town - and the Hyatt in the middle of things the second time.  Both were absolutely fine, the Hyatt would probably get my vote next time as it was an easy walk from here to the sights and sounds of Riverhead. OK, those sights and sounds won't take you too long to explore but there were plenty of good eating options. Jeremy and the Mermaid was right next door and had good seafood at a reasonable price while the Riverhead Diner and Grill will leave you pretty full. There are plenty of well-priced pubs in town too so Riverhead is a pretty good base all round. If you fancy a 10 minute drive to the north I would recommend Cooperage Inn as a good venue for a nice meal and good service.

While this area is perfectly hospitable, Manhattan it isn't. But let's face it, you will be here for the golf. Shinnecock in a must play if you can but if you add in the likes of  National Golf Links of America, Friar's Head and Sebonack then you have an amazingly high quality golf trip which you will never forget."
7,National Golf Links of America,"Southampton, NY",C.B. Macdonald,1911,NATIONAL GOLF LINKS OF AMERICA - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev7_national_america_1,"There are bucket golf courses which everyone has heard of, courses like Augusta, St Andrews, Pebble Beach. Then there are the courses which many are familiar from great US Opens and Ryder Cups - courses like Shinnecock, Merion and Winged Foot. But then there are courses which many will not have heard of by many average golfers but are simply amongst the very best in the world. Pine Valley would be a great example of this and the National Golf Links of America is another.

NGLA, or The National, is set on the north side of Long Island, adjacent to both the classic of Shinnecock Hills and the new pretender of Sebonack. The course is deemed one of the true classics of architectural design. CB Macdonald was the man with the vision to put together a collection of some of the greatest holes from the UK on this wonderful links land overlook Peconic Bay.  

Following several years visiting the best that the UK has to offer, Macdonald returned to the US and copied many of the best holes he had seen, as well as some originals, to produce the National.

In terms of that idea I think that it would be true to say that these holes are more 'inspired by' the originals rather than real copies. You wouldn't necessarily stand on the tees and call the holes they are copied from in all cases - although the Redan fourth is a pretty good effort!

This course has a more members feel to it than some of the new courses in the area like Friar's Head and Sebonack. The locker rooms were wonderfully old school - there was an exotic array of painkillers available to get you through the round, powders to cover all conditions and an honesty box for cigars and playing cards by the door.  

There were a couple of members ahead of us so we went out to the range. Inspired maybe by the UK links ranges there was nothing special here. No island greens to aim to - just a nice big field. We had no complaints at all and the setting by the dunes and the beach was great. Here's a little video to show you what it was all about.

The driving range facilities at The National

The practice green indicated that there was going to be a good speed to the greens and running very true and after a few nerve-racking putts we went to the first tee.

A word before going on about the caddies. We had a gentleman named Threewood carrying for two of us and a younger caddie taking the other two bags. Threewood has been caddying here for 10 years and caddied for Matt Fitzpatrick in the Walker Cup. The caddies get to play the course 4 days a week - what an amazing perk.  

Billy the caddie master displays a cup in his desk by the first tee which is awarded to the winner of the annual caddy competition between National and the next door Shinecock. NGLA have won 19 of the last 20 events, something they were very proud of! Threewood is a stalwart of the team and proved to be a great caddie, his reads on the green were wonderful and did his best to keep us out of trouble.
The National Golf Links of America has a famous windmill landwark
I will not attempt to describe it hole by hole - this article on Golf Club Atlas does a great job of that. What I will say is that the course does quirkiness to quite an extreme level. You get a feel of that from the very first hole with just a rescue needed down to a dell before wedging up to a very well guarded green which has massive ridges and slopes on. The second is then modelled after the fourth at Royal St George’s which if you manage a longish carry then gives you the benefit of a run down to a very driveable green for the longer hitter. My opponent got a really close up look at the windmill as his Pro V1 struck it smack full on!

The holes are really memorable and will stay with you for a long time. The Redan hole that comes at the fourth is definitely a worthy copy of the 15th at North Berwick. I think it plays a little easier as there is a bigger layup area short right at National but the bunker short left is probably more penal.

This is the kind of course which you know if you played a second time you would score better, there are so many trap to fall into - quite literally in the case of the 'Road Hole' bunker short on the hole styled after the 17th at St Andrews.

Do make sure you take the time to enjoy some ginger snaps and cheese spread at the halfway house before taking on the bank 9. You will need plenty of energy for the challenge ahead. 10, 11 and 12 are all incredibly tough pars 4s. The wind had turned after 9 so we played the whole course pretty much into the wind and these holes were a real challenge. The last holes are probably the strongest part of the course.  

After the par 3 Eden on 13 (modelled after 11 at St Andrews) you turn for home, using the windmill as a guide all the way up to the 17th tee. These holes don't require massive length off the tee to get home but do require the right line in to avoid very well guarded greens.  

The 16th 'Punchbowl' is great fun with everything around the green funnelling the ball towards the hole and the view from the 17th tee shot is breathtaking. This hole requires a long an accurate tee shot before a precision wedge into a green surrounded by sand. It was a nice place to get my first birdie of the round.

The 18th is the only hole on the course really next to the water, a par 5 which played a good three shorter into the wind despite being under 500 yards.

The course was a delight to play. I had expected this to be something special, given it's top 10 in the world ranking and I think it pretty much delivered. The only thing I would say is that in places it felt a little too quirky. Several times I found myself in lies where I was standing a over the ball in a tiny bunker which was incredibly hard to play and while I totally accept they are hazards they did try the patience a little!  

The condition of the course was just excellent and this is probably one of the highest ‘18’ rated course I have played, I just can't quite tip it into 19 territory - maybe my next visit will change that! You can see where it sits in my all-time rankings here.
The lobster 'amuse bouche' at NGLA has to be seen to be believed!
The course at the National is only half the story. The clubhouse is something of a national treasure too with a huge amount of memorabilia from the history not only of the National but of American golf. The drawing room has tables for a game of backgammon or draughts under the intimidating figure of CB MacDonald and make sure you spend time looking at some of the great pictures, cartoons and statues dotted around the place.

The ritual of lunch at the National is not to be missed if you get the chance. While you are deciding on your choices for starter and mains you are served a whole lobster, as an 'amuse bouche' which is quite something. Following that there will be a soup or other starter (the oysters were good) before having one of the traditional main courses such as cottage pie served with a healthy side of Mac and Cheese. Washed down with a Southside cocktail and bottle of very well priced Cloudy Bay wine it was quite a treat.

If truth be told I was expecting to leave the National with this as a shoe-in 19 but when I compared it to the great courses with that score I have come to the conclusion that it is just a touch behind. The course is just a little too quirky for me. Maybe if I played it a few times it would help me appreciate it all the more, but for now I will leave it at that. The lunch, well that was a 20!"
8,National Golf Links of America,"Southampton, NY",C.B. Macdonald,1911,NATIONAL GOLF LINKS OF AMERICA REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev8_national_america_2,"National Golf Links of America was the last round to fall into place during the New York trip. Whenever I mentioned that I would be playing the course to friends ahead of the round, they all said the same thing, “You won’t find another course like National anywhere else! You’ll love it.” Quirky, fun, and unique were the words that kept coming up, and my excitement for the day steadily grew, especially as we played Shinnecock the day before and peeked through the trees over to National.


The course was designed by C.B. Macdonald and it remains relatively unchanged from its original layout. National Golf Links has never had the pressure to adapt the course for professional tournaments, since it has never hosted a US Open or the like. The only major changes were a new set of tees added for a recent Walker Cup. Although we didn’t play those tees, a friend who has says they elevate the course to an even higher level. Like many MacDonald courses, the layout is comprised of template holes from Scotland. However, at National, they seem to fit the landscape better than nearly anywhere else in the US. National Golf Links of America was formed in 1908 and the Macdonald course opened three years later in 1911. 


The round at National Golf Links of America started early in the day. We drove through the imposing gates, changed shoes in the classic and understated locker room, and made our way to the range. The range borders Peconic Bay down the entire left side, which made for a distractingly good view… We met our member host on the range, struck a few more shots, and made our way to the first tee.


Right off the bat I had trouble finding my rhythm at National. I thought I had hit a good drive on the first, but it was too far left, so I lost the ball. I hit my provisional on target down the right, but it went through the fairway, leading to another lost ball in the rough. Two balls lost on the first tee… The tee shot is blind on the 2nd hole and the approach shot is blind on the 3rd. I finally began to settle into the round by the 4th hole. The start reminded me of so many Scottish links that make you think, “I will play that so differently next time!” There is a lot of local knowledge at National, and despite having caddies, they can only help so much when they don’t know your game or distances off the tee. Like so many of the great Scottish links, your strategy and understanding of National would evolve and deepen over time.


I wasn’t able to take as many photos as usual at National, so instead of my typical hole-by-hole review, I want to touch on my favorite points (which are numerous…).

Hole #4 – 181 yards – “Redan” – Similar to the original at North Berwick, this hole slopes from right to left and has a series of bunkers guarding the front. The angle is slightly different than the original, but it may be the closest replica that I’ve seen. As with many other Redans, the margin for error is small on this tough one shot hole.

Hole #6 – 123 yards – “Short” – This was one of my favorite greens on the course. It is massive, and depending on the pin position, it could play in an infinite number of different ways. The front right pin made the effective size of the green much smaller. We aimed about 15 feet left of the pin where a slope carries the ball to the right. The green is very undulating, so make sure you hit to the correct area.

Hole #7 – 467 yards – “St Andrews” – How am I not going to like a hole that is modeled off of one at St Andrews?! The blind tee shot isn’t pictured below, but the approach to the green looks innocuous enough… right? Well, there is a massive bunker behind the green the requires staircases to descend. The bunker on the left – the Road Hole bunker – is almost as deep as Pine Valley’s Devil’s Asshole. It’s not easy.

Hole #8 – 385 yards – “Bottle” – A group of small, narrow bunkers split the fairway down the left. Longer hitters can try to carry them up the left, but most players take it down the right. The green is raised with an intimidating group of bunkers short that collect mishits (see photos below).

Hole #11 – 418 yards – “Plateau” – This was yet another interesting green that marks one of the best back nines you will find in America. Drives end up short of the berm for most players, leaving a semi-blind shot into the green. Two well-placed bunkers prevent thoughtless approach shots. I ended up playing mine out left because of a bunker, even though I now realize I didn’t need to. Congrats, CB Macdonald. You beat me. Does anyone else see the similarities to the sharp mound in front of the fourth on the St Andrews Old Course?


Hole #13 – 159 yards – “Eden” – The Eden green is another nod to St Andrews (Old Course, 11th hole), which is most obviously seen in the bunker in the front center of the green. Distance control is important here, as you want to avoid those front bunkers, but don’t want to go long.
Hole #14 – 341 yards – “Cape” – This hole is a dogleg right with a drive over water. The smart play is a 220-yard shot out to the left, leaving a better angle into the green. A bunker runs down the entire right side of the hole, which is where I took the picture directly below. The second photo shows the small bunkers guarding the left side of the approach shot. 

Hole #15 – 368 yards – “Narrows” – The back nine at National Golf Links of America is special, but these final four raise the bar to another level. While this tee shot is fairly straightforward, the approach to the green isn’t easy. Any shot hit long can run over the green and into a lake behind it. Short shots roll back and a bunker collects shots leaked right. Aim center of the green and don’t miss!DSC00306DSC00307

Hole #16 – 394 yards – “Punchbowl” – Some of my favorite holes in golf are Punchbowls. In fact, the Course Reviews page on the site uses the Fishers Island Punchbowl for a background image. Well-struck drives can reach the top of this hill on the 16th, but the approach shot is blind no matter where you go. There is an aiming pole behind the green and bunkers short, so take plenty of club and hold the line.DSC00308DSC00313DSC00314

Hole #17 – 342 yards – “Peconic” – The 17th is one of the best views on the golf course. Bunkers down the left and in front of the green capture and misplaced tee shots. The best play is to hit a 220 shot running into the downhill fairway. If you click the photo below to enlarge it, you will see the entrance to National Golf Links just over the right side of this green. DSC00315
Hole #18 – 483 Yards – “Home” – This hole may seem short, but it plays straight uphill. Big hitters can carry the bunkers on the left side of the fairway, leaving a straightforward approach to the putting surface. It is a great birdie opportunity with a jawdropping view of Peconic Bay.

After the round we enjoyed lobster sandwiches and Arnold Palmers in the Birds Cage, which is the casual screened-in porch overlooking the 18th hole. If the view from Shinnecock’s back porch is the ultimate golf course view, neighboring National Golf Links must have the ultimate water view. You could happily spend all afternoon there soaking in the atmosphere and wondering how you ended up lucky enough to play the course!


I was amazed at how different Shinnecock and National Golf Links are. The two courses border one another, but they couldn’t have been more different. Shinnecock’s layout is right in front of you, while National’s blind shots and hidden features mean you would notice more each round. There are a multitude of different ways to play each hole at National, and like links courses in Scotland, you stand on each green and look back thinking, “Next time I will play this hole differently…” I completely understand why people love NGLA so much and I hope I am able to return one day to peel back the next layer of genius."
9,Oakmont,"Oakmont, PA",Henry Fownes,1903,Oakmont Golf Course: Legendary Layout for Ultimate Golfers,top100golfcourses,rev9_oakmont_1,"Other than Augusta National, Oakmont Country Club has played host to more important Championships that any course within the U.S. and it's considered by many to be the most difficult golf course in the world.

Oakmont is hidden among the Pennsylvanian hills close to Pittsburgh as well as steel magnate Henry C. Fownes fathered Oakmont in 1903. His son William was a who was a former U.S. Amateur Champion, continued his father's career for the duration of his life. The results can be summed in just three words: bunkers and greens. Oakmont's greens Oakmont have lightning speed, and the bunkering can be penal and is best illustrated by the famous ""Church Pews"" bunker, which is used to catch errant drives on the 3rd or 4th holes. There is a rumour that greens at Oakmont were slowing down prior to an event at the national level... They really are that fast.

""From its inception at the time that it was established to be 80."" said Mike Stachura in American Classic Courses, ""Oakmont Country Club has never made apology and never held anyone accountable. The club is known for being an arduous test of golf from the tee to the green and is awe-inspiringly laughing at golfers who come to play like a sly spirit. According the 1927 U.S. Open winner Tommy armour, ""a cruel and dangerous playground."" It remains. Par might no longer have been 80 for Oakmont It's not, but it definitely appears to be.""

Writer Darius Oliver wrote in his book Planet Golf USA: ""Oakmont was designed to be a solid but simple course that could be a great place to hit accurately, but punish the players who wandered off. The father and son (Henry as well as William Fownes] believed that golf had to be challenging for it to be fascinating, and they believed that bunkers were golf's best danger.

They also constructed some of the best and most dangerous greens on the golf course. The quality and diversity of their greens is simply amazing and the greens leaning towards every direction and designed to require golfers to attempt every possible approaches with a variety of challenging angles and lies.

Split in two via divided by the Pennsylvania Turnpike, Oakmont features two loops of road that run smoothly across the sloping terrain exactly the same way that it was when it was first constructed. The holes have been made longer narrower, more narrow and densely bunkered, however structurally, they haven't changed much in more than a century."""
10,Oakmont,"Oakmont, PA",Henry Fownes,1903,OAKMONT COUNTRY CLUB REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev10_oakmont_2,"The journey of playing top golf courses around the world takes you down unexpected roads. I was sitting at my desk at LINKS Magazine when an email came into my inbox. It was from the USGA and it offered the chance to play Oakmont in the 2016 US Open Media Day. The only problem was that it was a Tuesday, and the media day was less than a week away. I immediately booked a flight with my boss at LINKS and we started planning a last minute trip to Pittsburgh!

The funny thing is, I’ve been planning a Pennsylvania golf trip for this coming August. We have a round booked at Merion and Oakmont is a possible round on that trip. The thought crossed my mind to hold off and wait to play the course in August, but like they say, “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.”

Because it was the USGA Media Day, we attended a short presentation from a number of Oakmont and USGA brass before lunch in the clubhouse and an afternoon round. One of the most interesting speeches came from Mike Davis, the President of the USGA. He said that Oakmont was one of the only courses in the states that could host a US Open with two weeks notice. The course stays in championship condition throughout the season. Among many other things, he said that the normal course rating at Oakmont is 77 from the tips, but the course rating is close to 82 come US Open week… let that sink in while you gain even more appreciation for Johnny Miller’s 63 back in the day (and remember it’s a par 70)!

Oakmont was founded by Henry C. Fownes. He was a steel man who sold his business to Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie got him into golf, and Fownes proceeded to find land just outside of Pittsburgh to build a course of his own. Like many of the great course founders/designers, it was his “one hit wonder,” and he settled into a penal mindset with the design. Henry and his son William, who followed his father as club president, added bunkers, sped up the greens, and did everything in their power to make golf at Oakmont hard. William Fowne’s famous quote, “a poor shot should be a shot irrevocably lost” sums up the Fownes’ mindset very well.

I was told before the round that Oakmont was incredibly difficult. I’ve played very difficult courses before, but Oakmont was different. There was literally no margin for error. Combine that with having never seen the course before and it was all made tougher. My caddie would say, “Hit this down the left side of the fairway.” I would proceed to hit a well-struck drive down the middle, just right of target, and we would find it in the thick right rough. The greens speeds were some of the fastest I’ve ever seen, which made the short game exponentially harder. The player with a great caddie and tons of course knowledge will do well this June in the US Open.

My only “negative” comment about the club addresses something outside of their control. The Pennsylvania Turnpike runs right through the middle of the course. Crossing the bridges twice during the round isn’t tough, and the interstate is sunk into the ground, so it’s not even visible from much of the course. My complaint has to do with the noise. It is constant on much of the course. It isn’t a huge negative, but it means that Oakmont lacks that “sanctuary” feel that is present at many of the other truly great courses.

Hole #1 – 441 yards – Big drives will catch a downhill slope, leaving a wedge into the sloping green. Approach shots run hard left once on the putting surface.

Hole #2 – 325 yards – Long irons or hybrids land in the widest part of the fairway and leave short irons into the green. The dry creek bed along the left edge of the fairway is marked as hazard, but you can pitch out in dry conditions.

Hole #3 – 390 yards – Yes, those are the Church Pews along the left side! Don’t be short on this green and just as important, don’t be long. Balls run over this green easily into a difficult collection area (as I found).

Hole #4 – 512 yards – Although it isn’t mentioned much, the Church pews are in play again on the 4th hole. The blind layup and subsequent approach to the narrow green make it extraordinarily difficult.

Hole #5 – 349 yards – Favor the right side of the fairway on this blind tee shot. The short approach to the small and undulating green will be a fun one to watch during the US Open.

Hole #6 – 168 yards – One of the course changes since 2007 was flattening an area of this green to create more pin placement options… and it’s still extreme!

Hole #7 – 370 yards – The fairway is fairly wide for this blind approach, but the bunkers and deep rough surrounding the green are no joke.

Hole #8 – 225 yards – This is the legendary 300 yard par 3. It played about 235 during our round, but the large open front of the green allows for running approaches.

Hole #9 – 462 yards – The 9th plays back up to the clubhouse and a massive green. The rear of the putting surface doubles as the practice putting green. The distance on this hole may seem short for a par 5, but it plays uphill the whole way.

Hole #10 – 440 yards – While the 9th played longer uphill, the 10th plays shorter back down the hill. It narrows substantially closer to the green, so bigger hitters can just play a 3-wood down the right side of the fairway.

Hole #11 – 328 yards – Back up the hill again! Drivers aren’t necessary here for longer hitters, especially since a driver could reach the creek.

Hole #12 – 562 yards – This tee shot begs for a smashed cut that runs downhill and right on the sloping fairway. This is a birdie opportunity.

Hole #13 – 153 yards – Although the green is sloping, this is one of the easiest holes on the course. It should reflect that in US Open scoring.

Hole #14 – 340 yards – Difficult bunkers line both sides of this fairway, which narrows closer to the green.

Hole #15 – 434 yards – The tough finish begins here. The approach shot is blind, and penal Church Pew bunkers line the left side of this fairway (Did you know there is more than one set of Church Pews at Oakmont?).
Hole #16 – 211 yards – This hole is a beast. The bail out is left, but that leaves a very long put across the green to a back pin (click to enlarge the photo and look at the back right pin).

Hole #17 – 296 yards – This hole can make or break someone’s tournament (or round in the amateur’s case). Smart money plays a short shot up the right side and wedge into the green, but bold players can go for the green. See the small red flag in the distance? Also, don’t end up in any of the bunkers around the green.

Hole #18 – 430 yards – It all ends with a picturesque hole back to the clubhouse. The fairway bunkers on the right are very much in play. Most difficult of all is the sloping green – DON’T be above the hole.
Oakmont Country Club exudes history, tradition, and beauty. The clubhouse and locker room are on-par with some of my favorites. The course is extremely difficult, and frankly, it would be discouraging to play when struggling with your game. That being said, I’m sure it’s a fun feeling to shoot mid 80s at Oakmont before you go bust a 70 at any typical golf course around the country!2"
11,Sand Hills,"Mullen, NE",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,1995,Sand Hills Golf Club: The Club TFE Profile,Andy Johnson,rev11_sand_hill_1,"In 1995, in the remote Sandhills of Nebraska, Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw changed the trajectory of golf course architecture. Sand Hills Golf Club proved that a faraway course on spectacular land could work. It was a “field of dreams” moment for the golf industry, which had been focused for decades on building in population centers. Developer Dick Youngscap deserves immense credit for pushing the crazy idea of taking golf to the small town of Mullen, four-plus hours away from any major airport.
All our course reviews are available in Club TFE, our membership offering. To learn more about Club TFE and to join, click here!
Take note…

Sand Hills was built on a shoestring budget. Coore & Crenshaw did very little earthmoving. The only green that required a considerable shaping effort was the par-4 fourth green, which benches into the big sand dune and falls off hard on the right side.
In its original form, the 12th hole did not have a green-side bunker. That was added one year after opening to enhance the strategy of the hole.
On many properties, creating 18 holes is a challenge. At Sand Hills, the challenge was figuring out which 18 holes to use. Near a staircase in the clubhouse is a constellation map of holes from Coore & Crenshaw’s many routing ideas and efforts. It shows the over 130 potential golf holes in and around the valley where the current course resides.
Favorite hole

No. 2, par 4, 284-458 yards I’m a sucker for great holes early in the round, but there are a few other reasons why I love the second at Sand Hills:
Restraint – On a site where there are natural spots for bunkers everywhere you turn, the second hole has only one in play, and it’s there more to deceive golfers than to gobble up golf balls.
Green site – The most memorable moment from my first visit to Sand Hills was climbing the hill on the second hole and walking toward the green. The horizon line formed by the back of the green is all you see, and you feel like you’re approaching the edge of the world. Once you see the endless sand dunes in the distance, you get a sense for the magnitude of the locale. This view gives a context for the rest of the round.
Green contours – This is one of the most undulating greens on the course, and it’s really fun to hit shots into it. The ball will tend to funnel to pins on the left and be deflected from pins on the right. Both sides are exciting in different ways.
Overall thoughts

This is one of the greatest courses in the world. There’s so much to marvel at as you walk it. Two aspects of Sand Hills that stick with me most are how well the course embodies its place and how thoroughly worked out the strategic concepts of the holes are. I can’t think of any other club I’ve been to that has such a distinct feel and culture. These traits are shaped by the town of Mullen more than the membership itself, and much of the credit for that dynamic belongs to the club’s visionary, Dick Youngscap, who empowered the local staff to be culture setters. Sand Hills is unapologetically unique and its own. It’s not trying to be anywhere or anything else. Almost everyone treks long distances to get there, and the emphasis is on one thing: the golf. The accommodations are spartan, the food is outstanding but simple, the people are incredibly nice, and the golf is world-class. Part of what this course and its culture prove is that luxurious accommodations and amenities aren’t necessary. What is necessary is an outstanding course and a strong community looking after it. It’s easy to see that Mike Keiser learned something from the culture of Sand Hills and applied it to Bandon Dunes. If you’re curious what Sand Hills is like, imagine a more intimate and remote Bandon Dunes with slightly less stellar accommodations. Now on to the golf course itself. Every hole at Sand Hills has preferred lines. These can change day to day based on different hole locations and winds. Coore & Crenshaw were working with a tremendous place for strategic golf, as the natural elements are off the charts. The wind, dry conditions, and sandy soil make everything come alive. Coore & Crenshaw found strategy in a variety of ways: natural terrain, green contours, devastating hazards. Generally—and wisely—they opted for natural topography rather than artificial bunkering in many spots. Sand Hills is a great example of how the best architects are often the ones confident enough to leave a piece of ground alone and know that the topography will do the work for them. I don’t believe it would be possible for a serious golfer to play Sand Hills a few times and come away without at least a basic understanding of how golf strategy works. Along with the 18th hole, which we’ve already written about, the 14th is maybe the course’s clearest example of strategic design. This reachable par 5 offers an advantage to playing up the left because the green, the smallest on the property, is angled to accept shots from that side. Furthermore, the left half of the fairway offers the chance to catch a massive downslope into a big hollow, which will add 60-plus yards to a tee shot. The problem is, playing left is a risk because a massive blowout bunker sits there. Finding this bunker will eliminate almost all hope for a birdie and make for a challenging par. Hitting a long tee shot up the right is fine, but it leaves a difficult second shot, with a bunker short, a bunker long, and about 10 yards of green to work with. Even a layup is tricky. There’s plenty of room to the right, short of the green-fronting bunker, but it’s a nervy pitch from there. To lay up left, you have to contend with another massive blowout. Almost every hole at Sand Hills puts players in this position—take the risk right now or pass it off to the next shot.

If I were to critique two things about Sand Hills, I’d focus on the 13th hole and the lack of a walking culture. The par-3 13th is breathtaking; I’m just not sure it sets a consistently achievable task. Perhaps it’s yet another victim of increased green speeds, but the margin for holding any part of this green is very slim. As for the walking piece, I’ve been disappointed with how much cart golf at Sand Hills, which is such a wonderful—if hilly—place to walk. To be fair, the Sand Hills membership is on the older side, and most members go there to play golf all day. But I still wish more decided to walk and truly take in one of the cathedrals of the game. Sand Hills changed golf architecture. It’s a course that should be visited and studied by anyone interested in golf architecture as a profession. And keep in mind that for average joes, Sand Hills is attainable. A letter explaining why you want to experience the course may open up an opportunity for an afternoon round, an overnight stay, and a morning round. Not every letter is answered, but some requests are granted. It’s certainly worth a try. -AJ
Egg score: 3 Eggs

Sand Hills is everything a three-Egg course should be. The land is unique, beautiful, and perfect for golf. The design matches it, as we discussed earlier. It’s varied and strategic, and accommodates a wide variety of shots and skill levels. Superintendent Kyle Hegland does a marvelous job presenting the course, with the native vegetation deserving special praise. When you hit one out of play and into the taller grass, it’s usually easy to find your ball and feasible to get it back in the fairway. This is what well-maintained native does: it allows for the possibility of a heroic shot from an unpredictable lie. And that’s what you find at Sand Hills."
12,Sand Hills,"Mullen, NE",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,1995,Sand Hills Golf Club - Top 100 Golf Courses of the World,top100golfcourses,rev12_sand_hill_2,"The Sandhills region of Nebraska is a huge meadow, which extends to some 20,000 square miles but amidst the cowboys and the grazing cattle, lies a magnificent sandy tract of golfing ground, which is otherwise known as Sand Hills Golf Club.

Sand Hills Golf Club is a club to respect and those in the know admire their non-commerciality, which is a welcome break from tradition in these days of the perennial money-go-round. One hundred golf holes might easily have been laid out on this amazingly natural piece of land, but Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw settled on just eighteen. But make no mistake, they discovered the best possible routing and each and every hole at Sand Hills is very special indeed.

The ""Golden Age of Architecture"" inspired Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore to set up together sharing the philosophy that traditional, strategic golf is the most rewarding. And, when Sand Hills opened for play in 1995, they must have been quietly delighted with their achievement.

Sand Hills has only a few lucky members, and surely each and every one of them must belong to another golf club. Why? Because Sand Hills is closed for eight months each year… overplayed it is certainly not.

With wide, generous fairways that wind their way beside huge dunes, Sand Hills is a big course on a big scale and it’s tempting to open your shoulders. But beware of the sand. You will need to be either an extremely good golfer or a very lucky one to avoid the crater-like bunkers at Sand Hills Golf Club.

Darius Oliver had no doubt about the importance of Sand Hills his book Planet Golf USA, calling it “arguably the most important American golf course since Augusta National.” The author continued: “Its opening not only placed this remote and seemingly desolate region firmly on the golfing radar, but it almost single-handedly led to a rebirth in classic golf architecture in this country.

Although winds can whip through these Nebraska plains with great force, they don’t come from a prevailing direction, so the designers were careful to ensure their holes were playable under all conditions.

Fairways are sensibly spacious, while the target areas are mostly open to encourage chase-in approach shots. The diversity of the putting slopes is quite astonishing, as is the variety of the actual green locales, whether they be pitched in hollows, set atop plateau or built beside exposed sand dunes.”"
13,Augusta National,"Augusta, GA",Alister MacKenzie/Bobby Jones,1933,"Augusta National Golf Club (Augusta, Georgia)",Bill Satterfield,rev13_augusta_1,"Having never played the course, I can't speak with first hand knowledge of what it is like to tee it up on this holy ground. However, in 2012 I had the opportunity to attend a day of the Masters and regard it as one of the most enjoyable days of my life. Augusta National is a club like no other in the world and upholds the honors and traditions of the game with strict importance. Respect for members, club personnel, and the course is expected at all times; no exceptions. The course closes after Memorial Day and reopens in the fall upon the completion of any projects deemed necessary for the upcoming Masters. From what I hear, the experience at Augusta is unmatched. Video archives of the previous Masters are available to watch in the evenings when not on the course. Want to see Nick Faldo win the Master back-to-back in 1990 and 1991? Just ask, politely, and your wish will be granted. Want to relive Tiger's memorable twelve stroke victory? Not a problem. When playing at Augusta, a caddie will carry your clubs bag and help read greens as you stroll along the most immaculate and healthy turf in the world. There are only two sets of tees at the course (neither or which have slopes or ratings), the Members tee and the Masters tee, further confirming Augusta's mission and commitment to hosting the greatest golf tournament in the world. Simply put, Augusta National represents Bobby Jones' dream and is the holy grail of golf.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 155 Yard Par 3 – One of the most famous holes in the world and the heart of Amen Corner! This gorgeous hole can be as treacherous as it is beautiful. With Rae's Creek fronting the green and a pair of bunkers to the rear, absolute precision is necessary to hit this green in regulation. Located at the corner of the property and bordered by majestic trees, the winds can get swirling in this portion of the course and cause havoc with club selection. With its extensive history and unmatched beauty, Augusta National's 12th hole ranks among the finest holes in golf.

Best Par 3:  16th Hole – 170 Yards – Redbud has yielded more aces during the Masters than any other hole at Augusta and is yet another beautiful offering. The green features a large pond to the left and three bunkers around the putting surface. A spine is the middle of the green feeds balls left which creates mega drama when the pin is placed on the left side of the green in the traditional Sunday placement. During practice rounds at the Masters this hole has become an entertainment spot where players intentionally skip their tee shot off the water and onto the green. One of the most memorable moments on this hole came in 2005 when Tiger Woods had missed the green to the left before chipping his approach up onto the putting surface only to see it hang on the edge of the cup for a moment before collapsing into the hole and propelling Tiger to victory.

Best Par 4:  10th Hole – 495 Yards – The large iconic bunker in the middle of the fairway on this long par four is the last remaining distinctive stamp that is left of Dr. MacKenzie's work. The attractive edging on the bunker is inspired by camouflage from Alister's days in the army and used to be much closer to the green. When Perry Maxwell reworked the hole in 1937 the green was pushed 50 yards back so that the sprawling bunker is now more of a visual intimidation than it is a hazard to contend with. The hole plays well downhill and setups up for some dramatic results, as has been the case in recent years as the 2nd playoff hole during the Masters. It was on this hole that Bubba Watson hooked his approach shot from the trees onto the green before two-putting to victory. Most recently, this is where Adam Scott converted a birdie putt to edge out Angel Cabrera to become the first Australian to earn the coveted green jacket. This hole was also the beginning of the end for a young Rory McIlroy that hooked his tee shot into the trees before taking a triple bogey and watching his Masters dream walk away. Love it or hate it, the 10th hole at Augusta is the pivotal beginning of golf's most famous back nine.

Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 510 Yards – Other than perhaps the 18th hole at Pebble Beach, no other par five in the world is more highly regarded than Augusta's famous 13th. Brilliant in design, the hole banks from right to left with the fairway sloping left towards Rae's Creek. With the ball above your feet and creating a natural draw, the green calls for a ball to fade into the putting surface over Rae's Creek while managing to avoid the hillside of bunkers to the rear. Tee balls that draw around the corner significantly reduce the yardage into the green yet ball that stay to the right, shy of the trees, setup for a great angle to the putting surface. Phil Mickelson's bold and miraculous approach shot from the pine straw on the upper right side of the hole in 2010 has become an iconic image in Masters fan's minds. One thing is for sure, this hole always plays an exciting roll in the final outcome Sunday afternoon at the Masters.

Birdie Time:  15th Hole – 530 Yard Par 5 – One of the things that makes Sunday afternoon at the Masters so exciting is the risk/reward nature of the reachable par fives. The 15th plays up to the crest of a hill where players are then greeted with a downhill view of the green completely fronted by a pond. A lone bunker sits to the right of the putting surface and the drop area off to the left. The green is twice as deep on the right side as the left and a pond rests well beyond the putting surface in the event an approach shot comes in too hot. If you can't reach the green in two, there is a flat area to layup to on the left side of the fairway which will setup a short chip and an excellent birdie opportunity. The most recent drama at this hole occurred Friday afternoon in the 2013 Masters when Tiger Wood's 3rd shot ricocheted off the flag and into the water. In a temporary mental lapse, Tiger took an illegal drop which originally was deemed legal. However, following his remarks in an interview after the round, the committee deemed the drop inappropriate and Tiger was assessed a two stroke penalty the next morning. In terms of birdie time, the hole played the most strokes under par in 2013 while yielding 16 eagles and 118 birdies compared to 143 pars.

Bogey Beware:  11th Hole – 505 Yard Par 4 – The beginning of Amen Corner, this par four measures just five yards shorter than the par five 13th. A big drive is required to the top of a hill before the fairway begins fading right and then finally banking slightly left. Rae's Creek rests on the left side of the green and wraps around the back instilling fear into players as they hit their approach from the fairway that tilts left. Birdies are very rare at the 11th hole, the most famous of which was Larry Mize's improbable 140 foot chip that found the bottom of the cup and won the 1987 playoff over Greg Norman. Bogies (or worse) outnumbered birdies nearly 4:1 in the 2013 Masters; bogey beware indeed!"
14,Augusta National,"Augusta, GA",Alister MacKenzie/Bobby Jones,1933,Augusta National Golf Club - A Cinderella Story,John Sabino,rev14_augusta_2,"""I shall never forget my first visit to the property... The long lane of magnolias through which we approached was beautiful. The old manor house with its cupola and walls of masonry two feet thick was charming. The rare trees and shrubs of the old nursery were enchanting. But when I walked out on the grass terrace under the big trees behind the house and looked down over the property the experience was unforgettable.""

Augusta Entry Drive

The quote leading off the post is not mine, but is from Bobby Jones. His recollection is from seeing the property before the course was built and it is still the perfect description of it to this day. My attempt to capture my day at Augusta is below. Lou Holtz once said, ""I'm often asked to explain the mystique of Notre Dame. I reply, 'If you were there, no explanation in necessary. If you weren't, no explanation is satisfactory'."" For those who haven't had the opportunity to play it, it is quite difficult for words to do it justice. For those who are among the lucky ones who have, no explanation is necessary.

Augusta National Golf Club (ranked #5 in the world) is the hardest course in the top 100 to get on. I probably have to qualify my prior sentence so I don't get bombarded with email from Down Under reminding me that Ellerston Golf Club is probably the hardest in the world to get on, but that's another story and wasn't on my to do list. It took me fifteen years to get invited to Augusta National, but I finally managed to do it in style. All the pictures on this post were happily taken with my camera, and as you can see, the conditions were perfect when I was there. It was 74 degrees and sunny with a slight wind.

What better circumstances are there to play Augusta National than when the azaleas are blooming, when the course is in tournament condition and with a Masters winner or two? Well, none.

I saved the best experience for last, and walking off the eighteenth green of Augusta National as the last hole to complete my quest is the only way to finish. I am one very lucky bastard.

After I was invited to play at Augusta National it was overwhelming, and it took several days for me to come back down to earth. Because I am just a little anal and clearly I like lists, I immediately began to keep three: 1) People who were previously my friends who told me they now hated me from jealousy; 2) People who offered to caddie for me if needed; and 3) People who wanted ""Augusta National"" and not ""Masters"" logo items that you can only buy in the pro shop in the clubhouse. Sleeping the night before playing at Augusta was restless at best, the sense of anticipation was crushing. Sitting in my hotel room prior to the round, I was a clinical example of adult ADHD and displayed all the symptoms in classic form: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. I was babbling, moving things around the room senselessly and not listening to a word my wife said.

What was it like?

Short answer: Wow!

Long answer: It was one of the greatest experiences of my life, if a bit overwhelming. Driving under the canopy of trees lining Magnolia Lane is something I never dreamed would happen to me, so the range of emotions that I felt when it happened were wide, as I was trying to comprehend my dream being realized. The most prevalent feelings were joy, fear, excitement, disbelief, exhilaration and anticipation.

As anyone who has ever been to the Masters knows, everything about the place is perfect. Walking through the door of the plantation-style antebellum clubhouse is as memorable an experience as riding down Magnolia Lane. Having previously been to the Masters twice, I had already experienced the jaw-dropping awe of the property and its rolling hills. Not that it ever gets old, because it doesn't. Being anywhere on the verdant Augusta grounds is special, no matter how many times you have been there. This time, being able to walk into the clubhouse, an act previously verboten, was truly amazing. I do believe I had the biggest smile of my life on my face when I entered.

As with everything else in this adult version of Disneyland, the interior of the stately clubhouse is flawless. It is the antithesis of glitz and ostentation; it is simple, but elegant; the ultimate embodiment of understated Southern charm. There are scores of little touches they get right, including a mounted display board in the entry foyer. The board has slots that hold the engraved names of members who are currently on the property. They slide little brass name plates in and out as members enter and leave the property. I did my best not to gawk at the board, but did recognize a couple of names, including a former Secretary of State who was present. The clubhouse, with a two-story veranda around the entire building was built in 1854; is a veritable museum; touring it is special, as it holds the permanent Masters trophy, special golf clubs donated to the club from past champions and a big oil painting of President Eisenhower. Ascending the winding stairway leads you to the second floor, which houses the dining room where they hold the champions dinner each year and the champions locker room. Starting with Bobby Jones, and thinking about all the great golfers who have been in the clubhouse and walked over these hallowed grounds over the last 80 years gives me goosebumps.

My warm-up was on the driving range used during the Masters instead of on the members driving range. I have obviously played a lot of good golf courses and have experienced teeing off at some famous locales that are pressure packed, such as the Old Course at St. Andrews and the first tee at Merion with lunch in progress. Hitting my first tee shot at Augusta was the most nerve-racking of all and shortened both my breath and my back swing. My palms were sweaty and my stomach full of butterflies. The first drive is over a big swale, and although the fairway is wide, the target area is not, since it narrows between the huge bunker on the right and the big Georgia pines on the left. In retrospect, it was one of the narrowest fairway landing areas on the course. Making contact with the ball on the first tee was special. Having the ball actually go my normal distance down the fairway was a bonus!

I played well on the first six holes, then the gravity of the situation hit me and I fell apart for two holes. It is really hard to comprehend that I was lucky enough to be able to actually play Augusta National. Many thanks to the caddies who helped me stay calm and in the present and enjoy the moment. Just as all roads lead to Rome, all golfers dream of the back nine at Augusta on a Sunday afternoon, and here I am in just such a spot.

The practice putting green is near the tenth tee at Augusta National. After we teed off on ten, a multiple-time winner and Ryder Cup captain walks up to the tee and says, ""Do you guys mind if I join you on the back?"" Hard to conceive of, right? My playing partner says, ""No problem with me, John, is it ok if he joins us?"" What am I going to say, ""No, I'm sort of in a groove, why don't we continue as a two-some!"" My fairy tale story continues...

Nelson Bridge #13 Augusta

From tee to green there is no rough; so, truth be told, putting your ball in play is actually not that hard. The course plays 6,365 yards from the member tees. The fairways are generous, they look and feel like carpets, and every lie is perfect. The greens are also perfection, without question the best in the world.  The most difficult shots tee to green are those you have to hit off of the pine needles if you hit off the fairway. The real tests of Augusta National are chipping, holding your ball on the greens and putting. The greens are fast, as you would expect. They are significantly harder on the back nine, in my humble opinion. In particular, I found the thirteenth, fourteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth to be like putting on the top of a glass table.

I am an average golfer (15 handicap) and if there is one hope that I had going into the round it was to play Amen Corner well. A sense of calm and peace overtook me as I walked onto the eleventh tee. To be able to hit the same shots the professionals hit is a dream every golfer has. To be able to pull it off and not cease up was a treat. One of the highlights of my life was hitting the middle of the eleventh green in regulation (the hole plays 400 yards from the member tees) with a shot that got a ""great shot"" shout out from two former tournament winners. Luckily, my birdie putt was captured by my alert caddie who knew the gravity of the moment and took the camera out of my golf bag without being asked. I rolled it to within six inches. I was not disappointed with a tap in par to start Amen Corner. Walking over the Hogan Bridge is something that cannot be described; it is a solemn, spiritual experience.

Birdie Putt on #11 Augusta
Putting for birdie on #11 on a brilliant day with the azaleas in bloom

Standing on the twelfth tee I mentally blocked out the water, the ultra-shallow green, the bunkers in the front and in back, and everything else. I adjusted perfectly for the one club wind, visualized the shot, saw only the flag and took a very deep breath. I ended up hitting one of the best shots of my life, eight feet from the hole. This is the reason you stand on the range year after year and hit tens of thousands of practice balls; so that when you need to, you can pull off the shot of your life, and it was satisfying. On #12 the member tee and the pro tee are in the same place, so I had the exact same shot they hit during the Masters, a 155-yarder over Rae's Creek. My putt broke a good cup and a half and when it landed in the bottom of the hole for birdie, it was hard to absorb. I have had my ups and downs with my golf game over the years, but it was very satisfying to birdie what Jack Nicklaus calls, ""the hardest hole in tournament golf."" I was one under through two holes on Amen Corner, and hit a drive straight down the middle of the thirteenth fairway.  I didn't so much walk over Nelson Bridge as I did float over it.

#13 tee Augusta
The view from the back tee on the thirteenth

My luck ran out when my ball rolled back off the thirteenth green, but I was still overjoyed, having just lived every golfer's dream. When the legendary golf writer Herbert Warren Wind coined the phrase ""Amen Corner,"" he described it as your second shot on the 11th, the entire 12th hole and your tee shot on 13. In the original true sense of Amen Corner, I played it to near perfection. My favorite hole was the thirteenth; it is just breathtaking and on a scale that most golf holes can never achieve. The back tee on the thirteenth is one of the most peaceful places in the world. It sits in a little alcove set among the splendor and beauty of Augusta, and standing there one has not a care in the world.

#13 green Augusta
The approach to the par five thirteenth green over Rae's Creek

I am blessed, and for some reason the golf gods were good enough to let me play to my handicap when I played Augusta National. As is typical, I had my ups and downs. I hit my tee shot on sixteen into the water,  pulled my ball through the Eisenhower Tree on seventeen, hit my fair share of chip shots fat and three putted more than normal, as the greens were tournament ready. After my final putt dropped on the eighteenth green I shook hands with two green jacket winners. To say I was in a state of elation is a gross understatement. At that moment, I was the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

As an added bonus, after the round I also got to play the par three course and to have a drink in the champions locker room. It is quite small and intimate, with only three tables that seat four at each. The veranda outside the room overlooks the circular entry drive and Magnolia Lane. The room was full when I entered and I will leave it to your imagination as to who was in the room and what happened next. If I told you, you wouldn't believe me anyway. Hollywood couldn't have scripted it any better.

I have a big imagination. You have to, to envision playing Augusta and completing this quest. My experience at Augusta National exceeded anything I could have ever imagined. Any one of my experiences that day are remarkable in and of their own right. Are my descriptions hyperbole? Not in the least, when you experienced what I did as the culmination of a long journey. Collectively, they are truly hard to take in and represent a dream come true. The title song from The Wizard of Oz sums up my day:

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Would you go if invited?

Links Magazine did a readers poll a couple of years back and asked the following question, ""You're on a business trip in Atlanta and have an important meeting that cannot be rescheduled. The night before the meeting, you receive a last minute invitation to play Augusta National Golf Club the following morning. What do you do?""

57% responded that they would skip and meeting and play
43% said they would attend the meeting

The 43% are clearly out of their mind. Are you kidding me?

What PGA players think about Augusta

Sports Illustrated polled the players in 2012 about the Masters. Their answers are below and my opinion in parenthesis.

1. The 11th hole was ranked as the hardest. (I think the seventh and tenth holes are harder)

2. The 12th hole was ranked as the best hole and as the favorite shot on the course (hard to disagree)

3. The 13th hole was ranked as their favorite hole (I agree)

4. 62% of them had never tried the pimento cheese sandwich!

5. 50% of those polled said the major they would most like to win would be the Masters

Some of my favorite quotes about Augusta

""The course is perfection, and it asks perfection"" - Nick Faldo

""You get the feeling that Bobby Jones is standing out there with you"" - Lee Janzen

""I always said that if they have a golf course like this in heaven, I want to be the head pro"" - Gary Player

Augusta truisms

There are three truisms that anyone who has been to the Masters knows:

1. The neighborhood the course is in is more befitting to a suburban strip mall in New Jersey and is lined with Waffle Houses and fast food chains.

2. The steepness of the terrain doesn't come through on TV. Especially how much the first hole plays down and up. Also, the uphill shots required on nine and eighteen are much more dramatic when seen in person, given the big elevation changes. The most dramatic hole of all is the tenth, which plays almost straight down hill.

3. The entire property is perfect. Quite literally perfect. There are no weeds. Nothing is out of place. Those who have been to the Masters know how perfect it is, including the wooden pine bathroom houses that are spotless. The interior of the clubhouse is also perfect. I don't know if they paint the place every day, but the interiors of the buildings look like they were freshly painted. The flooring is polished, the carpets are spotless and look freshly laid, and the lucky people working there are charming and gracious, and make you feel at home. No detail is too small to overlook at Augusta National. Inside the clubhouse they don't use an electric vacuum cleaner since the noise would disturb the perfect ambiance of the place. Instead, they use an old school push style that makes no noise.

Unlike any other

Pine Valley is the #1 ranked course in the world and Cypress Point is #2, and an absolute dream land. Everyone talks about Pebble Beach, and you get chills playing the Old Course at St. Andrews when they announce your name on the first tee. But the course EVERYBODY asks about when I tell them what I've been doing is Augusta. Have you played Augusta? How did you get on Augusta?

I have played in some unreal and memorable places. My day at Loch Lomond was exceptional. My experience and the ambiance of the hunting lodge at Morfontaine is still something I think about all the time. It is also pretty hard to beat an overnight stay at The National Golf Links of America. Yet, this is the one to tell the grand kids about (some day). Everyone I meet in my life from now on will hear about my birdie on the twelfth hole.

Augusta trivia

Some interesting trivia facts about Augusta taken mostly from David Owen's The Making of the Masters:

1. The tress that line Magnolia Lane were planted before the Civil War

2. President Eisenhower never attended the Masters because of possible security problems

3. Before there were tour caddies, golfers recruited bellhops from the local Bon-Air Hotel to serve as caddies

4. Cliff Roberts handled Eisenhower's personal finances and investments

5. The golf shop makes change with new bills because Clifford Roberts didn't like dirty bills

6. There are no tee times at Augusta National. Captains of industry are very civilized and no doubt don't all show up at once. The limited number of cabins for overnight play self-regulates the number of people that play, as most members don't live locally.

7. The two nines originally played in reverse. The 1934 Masters was the only one played with the front and back opposite of the way they play today.

8. Augusta has no slope and course rating from the U.S.G.A. thus you can't really post your score after playing. I'm not sure why they never had the course rated, perhaps to do with privacy and limiting access?


What will you do now that you are done playing the top 100 courses?

People have asked me this question a lot. I contemplated giving up golf altogether, since what I just did can't be topped. Like Bobby Jones, I thought, wouldn't it be great to go out at the top. Jones retired at his peak in 1930 after winning the impregnable quadrilateral, as he termed the Grand Slam. My friends reminded me that I'm no Bobby Jones, so a few other ideas I'm kicking around:

1. Go back to Cruden Bay and play it over and over and over

2. Go and sit in the Sunningdale clubhouse for a week drinking Guinness and smoking cigars

3. Try to join the Links Club in New York

4. Eat at the top 100 restaurants in the world

5. Move to Queenstown, New Zealand, herd sheep and drive a taxi while playing golf at Jack's Point a lot

How did you get on the course?

Unfortunately, like in Las Vegas, what happens at Augusta National stays at Augusta National. This will remain my secret. That is, unless my book deal comes through with its big advance, in which case I will give all the details :). What I can say is that asking to play is futile. Like joining the club, you can't ask them, they have to ask you. Asking to play is an automatic no. Think about it, members would be inundated with requests every day if you could ask them to play since this is the course every golfer obsesses about. In this regard, Augusta National is truly unlike all other golf courses in the world. If you meet a member of Shinnecock Hills or Riviera or many of the other top courses, chances are you can ask them and as long as you are not a total JO, you can usually get invited, as they are proud to show off their course, especially to those that appreciate the history of the game and golf course architecture.  A prior post of mine does outline the ways you can get onto the course:  A Dozen Ways to Play Augusta. Good luck if you are trying, and sorry, I can't help.

What are your favorite courses and holes?

Alas, a complex question best answered by this post: The Best Holes and Courses. My day at Augusta was by far the best overall experience of my journey playing the top 100 courses given what happened to me on that day. In terms of the course only, I would rank only a half-dozen or so courses above it including Cypress Point, Sand Hills, the National Golf Links of America, Merion, and Sunningdale. My top five holes in the world are the thirteenth at Augusta, the fifteenth at Cypress Point, Maidstone's fourteenth, Kawana's fifteenth and the seventh at Sunningdale.

Was it hard to play the top 100 golf courses in the world?

Yes. To put the feat in perspective, by completing my quest I become only the 23rd person to do so, the same number of men who have been to the moon: The list of those who have completed playing. I tried to calculate the percentage of people in the world that have done this and dividing 23 into 7 billion gave a result with a lot of zeros after the decimal point. The odds of winning the lottery are higher than the odds of playing all 100 of the top golf courses in the world.

The hardest courses to get on aside from Augusta are Morfontaine in France, Hirono and Nauro in Japan, Wade Hampton in North Carolina, San Francisco Golf Club and The Golf Club in Ohio.

Thank you 

A heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been kind to me along the way, particularly those that hosted me and had to tolerate looking at my terrible swing. Thank you to all my loyal and supportive readers. Special thanks to my mates Tom, Chris and Sheldon who accompanied me to many of the world's great golf courses and are fabulous company. We have shared many laughs together. Thank you for being such good friends, I couldn't have done it without you. The biggest thanks of all goes to the most tolerant and greatest wife in the world! Thank you.

One of the lessons learned from this experience is to be patient. I pressed hard to get on Augusta for years and for the last two had sort of given up, and figured completing the top 99 courses in the world would be a pretty good feat. Little did I know that all those previous no's and rejections in my attempt to play the course were for a reason. Fate had decided that my quest should end with the ultimate climax. Just like in your game, sometimes when you give up, you play your best. Other lessons learned: be nice to everyone you meet, think big, have perseverance and persistence, and believe. There is no way to pay everyone back that helped me, so I will continue to pay it forward and share my luck and good fortune with others.

This will be my last post now that the quest is complete.

Post Script - Did I mention I birdied twelve?"
15,Merion (East),"Ardmore, PA",Hugh Wilson,1912,MERION GOLF CLUB (EAST) - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev15_merion_1,"It’s funny how you can have an idea of what a golf course is going to look and feel like, just to be completely contradicted as soon as you get there. Merion would be a perfect example of that for me. In my mind I had this as a heavily tree-lined, slightly claustrophobic, incredibly tight course. It is tight, because of the lush rough, but it is actually one of the most open properties that I have ever played. On much of the way around you can pretty much see the whole course and it really does have an ‘open’ feel to it.

I was luck to play here just a few months after the renovation by Gil Hanse and this is clearly a really quality golf course that is at the top of its game. The conditioning was just superb, with the greens running very true and just beautiful to play on. While the conditioning was spot on, it’s worth saying that the rough was fairly brutal. It was very thick, meaning sometimes it was hard to find the ball, and always difficult to move it forward. Having played a lot of golf in a short period of time prior to arriving at Merion, it would be fair to say I wasn’t firing on all cylinders and as such spent far too long looking balls in the thick stuff!

If you look at the scorecard for Merion it looks like this should be a course you can score on - from the members’ tees we played it was about a 6,200 yard par 70. While that may look inviting, believe me it plays so much harder. Anyone who keeps to handicap around here is worth a good 2 or 3 shots when they go somewhere else. 

If you are a fan of quirks then Merion is right up your alley. One such example if that there are only 2 par 5s on the property, and they both come in the first 4 holes! 

The course has a distinctive rhythm to it - with the thirds often referred to as Drama, Comedy and Tragedy.  The first six holes certainly ask some tough questions. After the dogleg first you find a par 5 with beguiling OOB on the right and then the long par 3 third where you need to fly the ball all the way to the green to avoid punishing rough and bunkers. However, by the 7th things definitely calm down and you then have a bunch of short par 4s and a couple of great par 3s - one long and one short. While this may tempt you into thinking you can attack the course a little don’t be fooled, be off line and the punishment will be just as bad as on the first 6 holes. This stretch of holes has some of the most of interesting and most fun holes you will find anywhere, with some wonderful, memorable nuances. 
The restored approach to the 16th at Merion is visually stunning and quite a test
The restored approach to the 16th at Merion is visually stunning and quite a test

The finish at Merion is tremendous - one of the very best you will find anywhere. The 16th is a par 4 where, for your second shot, you are forced to play over a quarry which Hanse has now restored with wonderful bunkering. There is a path around the right if you don’t fancy the carry. I went for the heroic route and failed. 

The 17th is a long par 3 - over 240 yards from the championship tees - which plays downhill to a huge (by Merion standards) green with a lot of movement in it. 

And then to the 18th, where Hogan famously hit his approach shot in the US Open all those years ago. From the championship tees it is a tough task. It’s a blind tee shot and then a long iron in to this green with a huge false front meaning that par here is a really great score. It really is a stunning finish. 

Looking back, I wish I had planned my trip to Philadelphia slightly differently. We played Pine Valley twice before making the trip to Merion and maybe it would have been better to have it the other way. Pine Valley is so ridiculously magnificent in every way, Merion was always going to be hard-pushed to match it.

Don’t get me wrong - this is a very fine course. Pretty much every hole asked a good question - how best to survive or how best to take advantage of what you have in front of you. The course looks wonderful. By all accounts Hanse has elevated it to a new level and the test is strong. 

However, something stopped me quite falling in love with this course. Much is made of how the routing works so well on a pretty small piece of land. Of course, that’s true, but Kingston Heath knocks it out of the park with the same challenge. The rough here is a little too brutal, and the punishment for missing the greens too great, to make this course a really fun one to play. 

Having said that all of that, of course if you get the chance to tee it up here you should jump at it. It’s championship golf of the highest order and a course that any fan of the history of the game would want to see.
BOOKING THE COURSE

OK, you can’t exactly call up Merion to book a tee time but it isn’t quite in Pine Valley’s league. Having said that, at some courses, like Shinnecock, you can play without a member being on the property with you. Not at Merion - here you need to be hosted at all times. The good news is that there are a lot of members and many of them play here quite regularly and are keen to show off the course. If you haven’t got a friendly member on speed dial then set up a Google alert for Merion charity auctions. Members quite often auction off the chance to play with them and there are also a few charity days. It’s not cheap, but it is possible.
The scorecard from Merion

TOUR TIPS

Merion is one of the great old courses in the USA and it would be a shame not to factor in plenty of time to explore the club. One of the most famous features here is the terrace that sits next to the first tee where members will be having their lunch while you tee off. In fact, when we played, the members tees were set slightly forward from the throng and it didn’t feel like we had too many eyes on us as we teed off.

This didn’t feel as ‘old school’ a club as Shinnecock or NGLA. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and there were a lot of women around as well as a bunch of kids and it had a little more of a ‘country club’ atmosphere to it. Having said that they were sticklers for etiquette and there is no doubt that golf is the focus here.

The pro shop is really well stocked and it’s hard to leave without a few items adorned with the wicker basket logo. The locker rooms were as traditional as they come and the showers had water pressure that even Muirfield would be happy with. We were heading off for a transatlantic flight straight after the round so had a good shower, but the lack of curtains did give off a certain ‘1950s British Boys’ School’ ambience which I think could have been done without!"
16,Merion (East),"Ardmore, PA",Hugh Wilson,1912,Review: Merion Golf Club (East),Andrew Harvie,rev16_merion_2,"Merion is, well, everyone knows of Merion, but most people don’t actually know that there’s two golf courses at this storied club. The West, down the road, is also a Wilson/Flynn, and the East, which is the one most of us have heard of. Needless to say, my expectations were high going in. I had a great day planned with two of my best golf pals and our host, who was a rockstar (which only enhanced the experience by a mile!). Back to the golf. Let’s jump into this wonderful little golf course.

Act I: The Drama

Merion’s East course is divided into three acts. Like a Shakespearean play, each act tells a different story and provides a different task. However, Shakespeares play are five acts (18 holes isn’t divisible by 5!). To start the golf course, you’re greeted with a 350 yard par 4.


Many have talked about how difficult the first tee shot is. No, not because it’s tight or long (obviously not), but because of how close it is to the patio of the clubhouse restaurant. You are steps from people having lunch. Thankfully, we teed off at 3:00 on a rainy October afternoon, so not too many people watching!


Just a couple spectators for the opening tee shot. On a warm summer afternoon this would be packed!
The opening hole gracefully moves to the right around a pair of fairway bunkers. A greenside bunker on the right side forces the player to go to the outside corner for a better angle.


As you can tell, I didn’t pick the right side of the fairway
After crossing Ardmore Ave, the first of two par 5’s on the golf course await. 589 yards on the card, it’s a long par 5 with O.B. all down the right and fairway bunkering on the left.


As I blasted one O.B., my host told me “you haven’t played Merion until you’ve hit one onto Ardmore Ave!” Happy to say I hit the ceremonial ball O.B. then, although it didn’t help my score too much.

This is kind of the first introduction to the scale of Merion. In the suburbs of Philadelphia, you wouldn’t expect this much movement, but it’s quite uphill on the second shot! Avoid the bunker for the second shot and you should be good to go.


The green angles to the left, in typical fashion. The closer to the right (and O.B.) you go, the better your look into the green becomes. With a wedge, however, not a huge deal.


Somewhere early in the stages, Merion, like National Golf Links of America, had template holes all over. There was a Sahara, Redan, Eden—some of them or soft renditions. Somewhere in the early stages as well, C.B. Macdonald, the pioneer of templates in North America, was involved. The third, originally, was thought of as a reverse redan template. Today, it doesn’t play too much like a redan.

At 219 yards to a green cut on the other side of the gully, it’s a beast.


I haven’t wrote too much about the greens yet, but they’re very difficult. There’s a ton of movement, and often times, there’s massive ridges running through the middle of the green that can make it very difficult to get to back pins. On the 3rd, with a back left pin, we saw that in action. A closer look at the green complex on the 3rd with the beautiful wicker basket.


The 4th is a monster par 5 at 628 yards. The aiming bunker cut into the hill is a perfect line to rip one over.


Words don’t really describe how difficult this second shot is. Frankly, it could be the most difficult layup shot on a par 5 I’ve ever played. A huge bunker cut at the top of the hill is perfectly placed. The length makes this an issue, even though it’s 200 yards or so to the green from there. If you play over it, you don’t see the ball land and you’re playing from a downhill lie. If you lay back, you’re dealing with the bunker and a potential blind third shot with a long club in.


The green is quite big with lots of pin locations, but there’s a copious amount of bunkers surrounding the green, and Cobb’s Creek fronts the green as well.


This is such a strong par 5. Par here is an excellent score. And that’s the last of the par 5’s! Merion ends with two par 5’s coming in the first 4 holes. From here on out, it’s 3’s & 4’s. You can get a sense of the scale below.


And the elevation profile. It really shows you how downhill the hole actually plays


The 5th, once described by Tom Doak as the world’s only “perfect par 4” would be the best hole on almost every other golf course in the world. It very well could be the best hole here, but there’s a couple contenders to me. At 504 yards, it’s a beast with a creek slithering along on the left. The hole banks hard to the left, with the fairway’s right side higher than the left side by about 15 (!) feet. hitting it up onto the right side is ideal.


From there, the hole continues to pitch hard to the right. A bunker up on the right hand side catches balls that need to be laid up (hazard, bunker, or rough, whichever). A line just over the the left edge of the bunker is ideal to kick the ball down.


I wish I would’ve got more photos of this hole because it is so good. But funny story: I actually drove through the night from Toronto to get to Philadelphia, picked up my friend who took the red eye from Edmonton, Alberta, and went and played Cobb’s Creek with a couple of local GCA enthusiasts the morning prior to Merion. It was a big day, I might’ve missed a couple photo opportunities.

Hole 6 is another difficult par 4 that we played around 440 yards. The US Open tee is out of commission, I believe, which would’ve been around 490. Two bunkers left and one aiming bunker right help you navigate the blind landing area.


The approach is a bit more low-profile than the first couple holes, but a false front stops balls. It’s a good green with quite a bit of movement towards the front.


Act II: The Comedy

What’s really special about this golf course is the routing. You don’t notice it through the writing, but 2 goes to the outside, then you turn inside for 3, 4, then 5 wraps back in between 4 and 2, and 6 comes out near hole 2 before turning to the outside of hole 4 for 7-9. Merion’s routing loops in on itself, but it wasn’t always like this. Here’s the previous version:


Quite a bit has actually changed from this original routing thanks to William Flynn. Hole 1 is different. The routing has also been switched up a bit. On that photo, holes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are actually 6, 7, 4, 5, & 3 in that order. Additionally, 10, 11 and 12 are very different on todays golf course, but we’ll get there. Below is the current routing.


The 7th starts the “Comedy” stretch of the golf course. Where the “Drama” gets the golf course onto a mixed bag start, the “Comedy” portion is made up of four short par 4’s, a long 3, one short 3, and a mid-length 4. It’s a great stretch of holes to make birdies. One of the beauties of Merion is that good players know they need to make birdies here to make it through the final Act, while members may sneak in a couple pars in this stretch and be happy with it.

Anyways, the 7th is 360 yards with O.B. to the right. One bunker on the left is probably best avoided, and this is the bunker you stood next to on the tips for hole 4.


The green it perched up, pitching hard to the front. With a wedge or short iron in hand, it can be difficult to control spin.


The 8th is a very good golf hole. 356 yards, a bunker right and left are staggered. Depending on the yardage you choose to play off the tee, one of the two will be in play.


A bunker short left and the restored ditch from Gil Hanse on the right front the green here. It slopes hard towards the ditch on the right. With a pin on the right side, it can be tough to keep the ball below the hole.


The 9th is a monster par 3 at 231 yards with Cobb’s Creek fronting the green and a huge bunker that the green wraps around on the left.


Here’s a different, closer to angle to hopefully show the undulation of this green. It’s a lot.


The 10th is a fun, drivable par 4 at 303 yards. Swinging hard to the left around a bunker on the inside corner, a layup (if you elect to layup) will have to flirt with the four bunkers on the outside corner for the best angle.


A big bunker short of the green from the tee and left from the fairway is the main defence. The green is more subtle in nature than the past couple, so a great birdie opportunity.


The 11th is most likely the most famous hole at Merion. Bobby Jones in 1930 completed the grand slam on the 11th green. Since then, it’s obviously become a milestone hole. At 367 yards, it’s a short hole playing downhill. A shared bunker complex on the left with hole 12 might be in play for some, but I imagine most will get it down the hill.


To a small green tucked behind Cobb’s Creek, it’s a very fun wedge to hit. As long as your ball doesn’t stay on the downslope, you’ll be good!


Part of the restoration, Gil Hanse & his team raised this green to prevent flooding from Cobb’s Creek, which has happened (so I’m told) fairly regularly if they get a rainy spring.

The 12th is a 403 yard par 4 doglegging up the hill that the 11th fell down. Three bunkers on the outside corner are wonderful aiming lines, but don’t get in them!


The fairway cants hard to the right, which actually helps the ball travel closer to the hole and sets up a fade to a green angled to the right. There is so much movement towards the front in this green that being under the green is paramount. Had it not been misting all day, I could see someone putting off the front of this green pretty easily if they’re above the hole.


The 13th plays on the other side of Armore Ave, and you won’t cross it again. It’s a very short par 3 at 115 yards, but ask Phil Mickelson—it’s not easy!


From experience, don’t hit it in that front bunker. Again, there is a ton of movement in this green, and almost collects like an upside down saddle (at least on the right side).

Act III: The Tragedy

After the drama and the comedy set the stage, the tragedy is all ready to ruin your round. It’s 5 holes of absolute madness.

The 14th is a 425 yard par 4 swinging hard to the left around a bunker that’s 275 to carry. A slew of bunkers on the outside corner of the hole await as well, and if you get really anxious, O.B. is way left. Getting the ball in play here is paramount.


You’ll notice on the approach shot instead of the wicker baskets it’s now the white flags. The club collects these wicker baskets and switches them out towards the end of the night because fraternity members at nearby Villanova University challenge other rushing members to steal a wicker basket to get access to the fraternity. Crazy!


This greens best characteristic, in my opinion, is the back left portion of the green, which is very cool and adds a fun pin position.

The 15th, a 411 yard par 4 swinging to the right, is harder than the yardage lists. O.B. all on the outside corner of the dogleg is certainly in play. It’s a different take; typically O.B. is seen on the inside corner (even last hole!) and you work on not turning it towards the hazard too much. On the 15th, you make sure you turn it away enough!


Playing up the hill, the approach shot up is a difficult one to judge. Again, a ton of movement towards the front of the hole, and certainly in the front portion. Staying below the hole is the best call to action.


The 16th starts. areal ‘meat & potatoes’ tough as nails finishing stretch. At around 440 yards, it’s not overly long. Getting the ball in play is so key here. If you miss, it’s not good.


From there, you chuck up a Hail Mary mid to long iron to a big green over the quarry. For the record, I hit it into the quarry and it wasn’t good. I did make a good up & down for 7, but that’s beside the point.


To make matters harder, the green has a massive ridge running through the middle that makes anything in the back half incredibly hard to get close to.

For those who miss the fairway, or have too much stick in for their second, the restored bail out on the right (which is actually 15 tee) is a perfect spot to play the 3rd from. Here’s a view of the quarry. Again—don’t hit it in here.


The 17th is a 246 yard (!!!) par 3. Working its way back down into the bottom of the quarry, it plays. a bit down the slope.


A fairly big ridge in the front portion of this green stops a lot of balls from running up. It’s said that this dip in the fairway/ridge in the green is inspired by the Valley of Sin at St Andrews. If it wasn’t hard enough, the green is surrounded by bunkering.


The 18th is a monster par 4 to finish. 510 yards, it requires a carry of 240 or so yards over the carry just to get the ball in play.


Playing over some wonderful rolling terrain, the 18th is a wonderful finish to an epic day at Merion.


So that’s Merion! It’s a very strong golf course. Speaking on the golf course, Jack Nicklaus famously stated:

Acre for acre, this may be the best test of golf in the world
No doubt, Merion at 126 acres is a very impressive golf course. It still blows my mind that on such small acreage, you never feel cramped, and the scale is quite big. After Gil Hanse’s restoration, it’s looking and playing great. One of the most special days in golf for me, and a course I’ll remember forever!"
17,Fishers Island,"Fishers Island, NY",Seth Raynor,1926,Raynor’s Final Symphony: Fishers Island Club,Andy Johnson,rev17_fishers_1,"Architects are often judged by their masterpieces. For Alister Mackenzie, it’s Cypress Point. For Charles Blair Macdonald, it’s National Golf Links of America. For Donald Ross, it’s Seminole. For A.W. Tillinghast, it’s Winged Foot. For Seth Raynor, it’s the Fishers Island Club.

Special thanks to Jon Cavalier for use of his photos in this profile. Seth Raynor was cast as C.B. Macdonald’s right hand man for the early years of his career. But as Macdonald’s interest in designing courses waned, job inquiries trickled down to Raynor, who perfected his architecture craft and gained a deeper understanding of the game at courses like Shoreacres, Camargo, Blue Mound, Yeamans Hall and the Course at Yale. Fishers Island was Raynor’s final and greatest symphony. During his short but illustrious career, Raynor often turned less-than-desirable land sites into spectacular courses. His portfolio of template holes – the redan, cape, short, biarritz and double plateau – ensured a course delivered a fun, thought-provoking and strategic test. At Fishers he got a waterfront property with tremendous natural land movement. He turned it into one of the finest courses in the world. Unfortunately Raynor didn’t live to see the end product. He caught pneumonia as Fishers Island was nearing completion, forcing his associate Charles Banks to finish the course.
The experience

Entrances are often talked about at golf courses. The drive into a club builds anticipation and excitement for the day. Fishers offers a truly unique “entrance” – a ferry ride across the Long Island Sound to the island. Coming from the Nauck Harbor, we rode the Popeye shuttle and arrived at the dock situated off of the 17th hole. After a quick stroll down the wood planks, our carts awaited us and we drove to the clubhouse. Unlike many exclusive clubs, Fishers Island is the furthest thing from “stuffy,” offering a laid-back vacation vibe that makes you feel at home.

We met the superintendents, Don Beck and David McIntyre, by the putting green, each of whom quickly apologized for how “green the course was,” music to our group’s ears. It was subtle, but the comment exemplified what Fishers is – a golf course architecture fan’s nirvana. For first-time readers, let me make it clear that there is nothing I love more than a firm and fast golf course. I believe that the effort to present a green golf course is one of the major issues with golf, creating sustainability issues and promoting poorer playing conditions for the average player. Raynor was known for his bold green concepts; the redan, the double plateau and the punchbowl have massive ridges that make them easily distinguishable. But the subtle ridges, rolls, spines and humps in his putting surfaces at Fishers are what places them among the best in the world. These design subtleties are woven in from the tee through the green on every hole at Fishers Island. I often judge a golf course by whether it inspires an immediate replay. At Fishers, my play was not good, but on the 17th hole I was sad to see the round nearing its end. The course and club deserve all of the acclaim and possibly more. It’s one of the finest golf courses in the world.
A quick history lesson

Started by the Ferguson family in 1925, the Fishers Island Club was set out to be modeled after Mountain Lake, the vibrant country club community in Lake Wales, FL. Naturally the Fergusons went after the man behind Mountain Lake, Seth Raynor, to design their golf course on the farmlands of Fishers Island. Upon walking the property, Raynor found two superior sites for 18 hole golf courses, one where Fishers Island sits today and another that was planned to be developed until the Great Depression cut plans short and the additional course’s development was abandoned. Over the years, Fishers has done an exemplary job of keeping the original golf course intact and staying true to Raynor’s intentions, planting few to no trees, maintaining firm and fast conditions and recently undergoing work to recapture the original green sizes.
The course

The 6,636-yard par-70 course is filled with jaw-dropping vistas of the Long Island Sound and Raynor’s famed template holes. Two of Raynor’s standout skills – routing and building green complexes – are on full display at the venerable site. His routing maximizes the holes on the water, providing drama at every turn while using the natural land movement as his fairway hazard, only employing two fairway bunkers on the course. The overlooked aspect of Fishers’ routing is how nearly every hole plays in a different direction, which allows the course’s best defense, the wind, to play a starring role. Golfers are kept in a constant state of confusion as they try to find the exact direction and strength of the wind on a given hole.

While a few holes are similar in direction, none are identical

HOLE #1 “Raynor’s Start” – 396 yards – par 4 As is customary with most Raynor designs, the first is a friendly start. The wind is typically at your back and the tee shot plays downhill. The water on the right comes into play 300 yards from the tee, requiring longer players to choose whether or not to play aggressively. The fairway cants from left to right, and the green is perched with a light back to front slope playing slightly uphill. One of the subtle, strategic aspects of the 1st is how the safe play off the tee is down the left side, but on that half of the fairway the left-to-right slope is severe. Consequently, a shot to the left of the fairway yields a more challenging approach shot than the flatter right half, which carries the risk of the water.
HOLE #2 “Redan” – 184 yards – par 3 The original green for the 2nd hole was lost to a hurricane, forcing the club to rebuild the green. The hole plays slightly downhill and the wind is a critical factor. As with all redan holes, the green slants from front-to-back and right-to-left around a deep front bunker. Unlike most golf holes, the ideal miss on the redan is long which leaves an uphill putt or chip to the pin. This rebuilt version of the template is gentler than most, and therefore plays more tamely, especially with regard to the kick slope.
HOLE #3 “Plateau” – 335 yards – par 4 One of the most memorable holes at Fishers Island is the short par-4 third, which plays uphill and seemingly to the edge of the world. The hole doglegs slightly to the right and tests the appetite for risk. The safe play is a long-iron up the left side, but a well-struck driver can get long-hitters close or even home. The dominant features at the 3rd are treacherous greenside bunkers, which flank the right and left sides of the narrow back to front sloping green.
HOLE #4 “Punch Bowl” – 412 yards – par 4 The fourth is considered by many to be the greatest golf hole in the United States. It’s a variety of the Alps template and perhaps the greatest version in golf. The strategy of the hole is dependent on the day’s pin position, which is noted by a peg board.

If the flag is on the right side of the green, the left side of the fairway is preferred and vice versa. A smart play is to pull long iron and play it up the fairway, leaving a short to mid-iron approach to the blind green. If you choose to play boldly, a driver that cuts the corner will leave a wedge shot and maybe even a partial view of the green. For those who lay up, the second shot requires trust in your line off of the Fishers Island flag that marks the center of the green. The yardage to the pin cannot be measured by lasers and your swing will feel unstable as the wind typically is whipping down and off the Sound. Coming over the hill and seeing the punchbowl green set back against the ocean is a sight to behold and one that is truly unforgettable. While it has bold exterior contours, Raynor’s subtle spine which runs through the middle is the true genius of this putting surface. The simple contour plays a factor in nearly every pin for shots just a little off-target.
HOLE #5 “Biarritz” – 229 yards – par 3 Continuing on the jaw dropping stretch of holes is the biarritz fifth, which plays parallel to the Long Island Sound, giving the long par-3 the added challenge of strong winds. With the water on the right, the natural bailout for golfers is left, where Raynor places two deep trench bunkers. The front of the biarritz is kept as fairway and when the course is firm and fast, the approach is conducive to low-iron shots that bounce the ball onto the green. The green complex is a big square, which has back to front slope and another subtle ledge that comes into the play on the back half. This divides the left two-thirds of the green from the back-right corner, which is slightly elevated for a devilish pin position.
HOLE #6 “Olinda” – 555 yards – par 5 The first par-5 plays from the shore back into the mainland and shows off the incredible natural land movement on the island. The new tee box is back to the right and semi-blind, favoring a fade to the fairway, which slightly angles right. After reaching the top of the hill, a beautiful view of the green awaits, giving a preview of the terrific seventh hole as well. The 6th often gets overlooked among Fishers’ amazing waterfront holes, but Raynor’s restraint from using fairway bunkers is beautiful, opting to allow the natural rolling land to obstruct players shots and layups. Finding a relatively flat lie is difficult and makes it a challenge to go for the green in two or even lay up in the correct position. The green is another square complex, which slopes from back to front. In the last year the back portion has been recaptured, which repels balls off the green. An interesting aspect of Raynor’s design approach is how on the lengthy par-3 second and the fifth he rewarded players who boldly miss long, while on the shortish par-5 sixth, a bold player who misses is penalized with a very difficult recovery.
HOLE #7 “Latimer” 363 yards – par 4 Perhaps the most overlooked great hole at Fishers Island is the strategy-packed short par-4 seventh. Playing from an elevated tee, the first decision posed to the player is whether to play aggressively with a driver or lay up short of the salt marsh. The second choice is which side of the fairway to favor. The safe side is left but it leaves a poor angle, while the ideal approach comes from the right side but brings the salt marsh into play. Due to the elevated nature of the green, an approach from the fairway is necessary to hold the firm, wind-blown putting surface, which slopes from back to front and features a dramatic false front.
HOLE #8 “Road Hole” 465 yards – par 4

The eighth was converted to a par-4 in the early 2000s and is a challenging rendition of the road hole. With the sound on the right and a pond on the left, a good tee shot is a must to this fairway that slopes heavily from right-to-left. Typically playing into the wind, a solid tee ball still yields a lengthy approach to the tough template green, which is guarded by a deep front pot bunker. There is plenty of room to bail right but it leaves a tricky chip across the green, which slopes from right to left and back to front.
HOLE #9 “Double Plateau” – 365 yards – par 4 Fishers’ front nine comes to a dramatic close with a short par-4, which features one of golf’s greatest green complexes, the double plateau. The tee shot is blind, up over a hill and one of two fairway bunkers on the property. After navigating the tee ball, Raynor treats golfers to another great reveal, as the double plateau green seemingly floats out over the sound. Its bold undulations divide the putting surface into three distinct segments that, when playing firm and fast, make the proper approach angle critical. If the pin is front-left, the proper angle is from the left; front-right, the right side is preferable and with the back pin the center to left side of the fairway is best.
HOLE #10 “Knoll” – 401 yards – par 4 Make the turn and players are treated to a rare sight, an unchanged and original knoll hole, one of Raynor’s templates that was often ruined by greens committees who thought they knew better. Completely bunkerless, the 10th is one of the toughest holes on the course. Finding the fairway is a must to set up a reasonable approach to the elevated green, which repels balls that are slightly short, long, right or left. Depending on the pin position, the favored approach angle will change, giving players a little more green to work with on their approaches. As the wind picks up the 10th only gets tougher.
HOLE #11 “Eden” – 164 yards – par 3 Photos don’t do the 11th justice. The short par-3 is perhaps the best representation of the famed Eden hole at St. Andrews. The green slopes severely from back to front and right to left making any putt from above the pin dicey. The worst place to miss on this challenging par three is in the devastatingly deep “hill” bunker.
HOLE #12 “Winthrop” – 389 yards – par 4 After the truly remarkable waterfront stretch of the Nos. 3-11, Raynor navigates players inland toward a stretch of overlooked holes that possess incredible strategic challenges and phenomenal green complexes. The first of those is the 12th, which embodies a great deal of strategy stemming from its elevated, reverse-redan green complex. Off the tee, players have to decide how aggressively they will play, taking anything from a driver to a long iron. The fairway has ample undulation that moves from left to right and has a large hump which can obstruct approach shots with an uphill or downhill lie. The green slopes hard from left to right and front to back and has a subtle knob in the middle that affects putts to almost every pin. The hole typically plays downwind, which makes the approach shot extremely difficult to hit close because of the green that slopes severely away and is perched some 30 feet above.
HOLE #13 “Waterloo” – 400 yards – par 4 The 13th plays back towards the 12th tee and is a slight dogleg right. Much like the twelfth, the strategy is influenced significantly by the wind direction. If it’s into the prevailing wind, the play off the tee is a driver down the right side of the fairway which opens up the ideal approach angle to the large squared off green, avoiding the second and final fairway bunker, which is blind from the tee. The second shot plays over a pair of ponds and into the green complex, the star of the show. It has a false front and bold kicker on the left corner, which feeds shots toward the center. Raynor bisected the green with a small spine that penalizes players who miss their mark to the right or left and the front-left section of the green has a small bowl that makes for a fun pin.
HOLE #14 “Cape” – 425 yards – par 4 On the flattest piece of the property, Raynor went to the fail safe template he used at every course he designed – the strategy-packed cape hole. Long hitters will be tempted to carry the water down the left at 290 yards, but the prudent play is an iron to the right. The ideal line is down the left side of the fairway, which drastically shortens the approach shot into the green but carries the added risk of the water. I fanned a 3-iron to the right side of the fairway and was left with 200 yards into the green, a number that could have been 30 yards less had I taken my tee shot down the left side. The green is another special one with bunkers on the right and left, and a severe false front. It requires an excellent approach shot to make a birdie. I found the back-left portion of the 14th green to be the most interesting as it features a small ridge that allows for a slightly bolder approach to the green with the comfort of a backstop.
HOLE #15 “Long” – 541 yards – par 5 The 15th starts Fishers’ closing stretch with a reachable par-5. The tee shot is blind and over a marsh obscuring a generously wide fairway. The right side of the fairway opens up the green, especially the back-left corner for those attempting to get home in two. The green slopes heavily from back to front and is guarded by bunkers on either side. The left bunker is particularly deep and a brutal spot to find yourself if the pin is on the left side. Like most greens at Fishers, the 15th has many small intricacies. The right third of the green plays into a small bowl with the left two-thirds elevated and on its own tier.
HOLE #16 “Short” – 146 yards – par 3 This photogenic short hole is extra difficult at Fishers because of the always-present wind. Despite playing less than 150 yards, I was forced to hit a 6-iron because of the prevailing wind, which typically is in player’s face. The green is surrounded by trouble with bunkers catching small misses and marsh penalizing the wide misses. As is typically the case, Raynor saved his wildest green for the short, making par a formidable test on the seemingly easy par-3. The 16th green’s exterior slopes funnel shots on the edges into the bunkers while the center slopes to the right, with a thumbprint on the back half making any putt not directly below the flag extremely fast. The unique aspect of Fishers’ short is the right side, which is obstructed from the tee but allows for a pin that seemingly floats above the marsh. Getting to that pin is a tall task and the prudent play is just slightly left of it, allowing the slope to funnel the ball to the corner.
HOLE #17 “Coast Guard” – 415 yards – par 4 The 17th features one of the widest fairways on the course, which allows players to set up a proper angle to attack the day’s flag. The prevailing wind at Fishers typically has the 17th playing into a strong left-to-right crosswind, which makes the second shot to the big green difficult. The green is sloped from back to front and has a false front which repels any shots slightly short or with too much spin. There is a small spine that runs down the left third of the green, creating an added obstacle for any pin on the left half of the green.
HOLE #18 “Home” – 452 yards – par 5 The closer at Fishers Island is a long and challenging par-4 that plays into the prevailing wind. The tee shot favors a fade and will leave a mid- to long-iron into a boldly-contoured green. The second shot plays uphill and the large, wide green is guarded by bunkers in front and to the right. Raynor gave players an ample opening to play a low running shot into the green, which is divided into three distinct sections: the front-right portion, which slopes significantly from back to left; the back ledge; and the front-left bowl. Hitting the green in two is an accomplishment, but a player who finds themselves on the wrong ledge will be left with a challenging two-putt to close out the round."
18,Fishers Island,"Fishers Island, NY",Seth Raynor,1926,Fishers Island Club,top100golfcourses,rev18_fishers_2,"Fishers Island Club is set romantically on a narrow island that is a mere two miles wide and eight miles long. The island sits between the National Estuary of the Long Island Sound and a series of lakes and ponds. It’s a magnificent watershed where saltwater meets freshwater and it’s a diverse haven for plant and animal life. The course is rather heavenly too, offering the most beautiful and natural water views from virtually every hole.

The club was founded in 1927 and Seth Raynor laid out the golf course in a rather links-like style. With numerous stage-like plateaux greens that are protected by cavernous bunkers, the key to scoring well rests with accurate approach play. Gil Hanse has been advising Fishers Island Club on course restoration since 1995.

Fishers Island Club measures 6,566 yards from the tips so length is not the issue, the essential element is to keep the ball in play. The rough is brutal and, as we have already mentioned, the bunkering is profound and often penal.

Fishers Island is not the easiest course on which to get a game – you’ll need to befriend a member – but stick with it because this is one of the finest and most enjoyable golf courses in the world.

The following article was written by golf architecture enthusiast Ed Getka and is an edited extract from Volume Four of Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective. Reproduced with kind permission. To obtain a copy of the book, email Paul Daley at fswing@bigpond.net.au

Fishers Island is a landmark golf experience that begins with the ferry ride from Connecticut. As you sit there with your clubs beside you, your gaze is drawn toward the island with eager anticipation. For this is a rare privilege that few are fortunate to experience. Fishers Island Club prefers to remain out of the spotlight, yet but one cannot help but extol the virtues of its layout. When driving along, soon after arrival, you see the movement of the land: your sense of anticipation heightens.

Finally, you pull up on a rise to the understated clubhouse and take in your first look at the course – the first hole stretching down towards the green beckoning in the distance. Shoes are quickly changed in the small room just off the clubhouse entrance: you just can’t wait to get out on the course. For the newcomer, one may be wary that the course could possibly disappoint – but Fishers Island just steals your heart.

As you make your way around the property and glory in the course, the incessant wind, the views, and the golf that is required of you, it is hard to imagine a more delightful place for a game. It is no accident that the charms of this land are captivating.

The golf course was a result of a 1925 collaboration of Frederick Law Olmsted Jnr and Seth Raynor. Olmsted, following in his father’s footsteps, became a pre-eminent landscape architect, as well as making significant contributions to the development of the National Park Service. At Fishers Island, he did a remarkable job of integrating home sites and open spaces into the development that became Fishers Island Club.

Raynor was a disciple of Charles Blair Macdonald – one of the pioneers of golf course architecture in the USA – and a qualified surveyor with an engineering background when he assisted Macdonald in the creation of the National Golf Links of America. Learning the principles of golf design so well, in spite of never playing golf, Raynor went on to establish himself as a golf course architect. Fishers Island was his crowning achievement. Unfortunately, he never saw its completed form, as he died from exhaustion and pneumonia six months before opening day. At the time, Raynor was in the middle of 30 design projects, surely a scenario that would do little for one’s health.

Generally, you will find the course to be wonderfully firm and fast with your ball bounding along the fairways at speed. This will suit you just fine, of course, until an unnoticed contour takes your ball somewhere you didn’t intend. Such are the vagaries of links-style golf and they only add to your enjoyment of the day here. As you think back over your round, the predominant theme is the fun you’ve had had taking on the diverse challenges this course presents. Fishers Island is never far from my thoughts and when I daydream about golf it is here that I most often go."
19,Los Angeles (North),"Los Angeles, CA",George C. Thomas Jr.,1927,Los Angeles (North),top100golfcourses,rev19_la_north_1,"The location for the Los Angeles Country Club makes it possibly one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in the world. It’s therefore fitting that the North course does full justice to the land because it is a truly magnificent layout.

The club was founded in 1897 as the Los Angeles Golf Club, moving locations three times before settling on its current site adjacent to Beverly Hills in 1911. The original club founders, Joe Sartori and Ed Tufts, along with Norman Macbeth and Charles Orr, laid out the inaugural course at the new Wilshire site.

The course (now known as the North) at the renamed Los Angeles Country Club was refashioned by Herbert Fowler in 1921 but re-routed in 1927 by George C. Thomas Jr. and his right-hand man, William Bell, with excellent effect. Fast-forward to the new millennium when Gil Hanse was entrusted to restore this classic course to its former glory.

The layout is at once thrilling and often exciting with its hills, ridges, swales and valleys. There are two 18-hole courses, the North and the South, if you can get a game, but only have time for one round, try and persuade your friendly member to play the North course.

There are far too many great holes to mention them all, but the par threes are exceptionally strong, exactingly long and noteworthy. The 7th is perhaps the toughest of them all, measuring almost 240 yards where only the perfect tee shot will find the sanctuary of the green. The 9th is perhaps the signature hole, with the clubhouse as the backdrop, but many members consider the 11th to be the star of the show with downtown LA as the backdrop.

As far as parkland courses go, Los Angeles North is as good as it comes. The course holds your interest all the way round and it’s a challenging and tough but fair layout. Roll this up with a beautiful setting (except perhaps for the odd imposing tower block) and you have a little piece of heaven."
20,Los Angeles (North),"Los Angeles, CA",George C. Thomas Jr.,1927,"Los Angeles Country Club (Los Angeles, California)",Bill Satterfield,rev20_la_north_2,"Los Angeles Country Club is a historic club dating back to 1897 with the famous North course being developed in 1921. The club's first course was the 18 hole South course which ends up playing second fiddle to the championship North course. The USGA has begged LACC for years to host a U.S. Open or other major event but the elite membership has continually turned them down. The George Thomas design is first rate and features nice elevation changes while the William Bell bunkers are visually appealing yet still penilizing. It is a classic walkable course that represents one of the best parkland courses in America.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  11th Hole – 244 Yard Par 3 – Easily the signature hole of the course and one of the best par 3s anywhere. In fact, some years ago Golf Digest rated it the 23rd best par three in America.

11th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (244 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  11th Hole – 244 Yards – There is no arguing that the reverse Redan 11th at LACC is not only the best par 3 at the North course, but one of the best in the world. All the par 3s at Los Angles Country Club's North Course have a significant amount of length to them, but the 11th gives golfers the opportunity to fly the ball a shorter distance and utilize the slope that funnels into the green.

11th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (244 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  3rd Hole – 385 Yards – A barranca protects the left side of the hole and leads into a plateau portion of the very contoured fairway at this uphill hole. From there, an intimidating shot over a William Bell bunker that fronts of the green is required in order to find the putting surface. In the picture below you can see the Los Angeles skyline look back towards the tee box from behind the green.

3rd Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (385 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  8th Hole – 561 Yards – A barranca disects the fairway and creates two separate alleys to play through. Given the angles of the fairway and placement of the trees, this hole becomes a true three-shot hole that features a cascading second fairway and 30 yard deep green. Utilizing the barranca throughout the design is one of Thomas' strong points at LACC and the golfer seems some of his best work at the 8th.

8th Hole at Los Angeles Country Club (561 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  6th Hole – 340 Yard Par 4 – An excellent risk/reward opportunity is afforded to the golfer at the short 6th hole. A barranca encircles the green like a mote protecting a castle and strikes fear into the golfer banging on his driver in hopes of finding the green, or a short chip. The 90 degree dogleg right hole requires a 225 carry just to catch a view of the green on a safe line straight off the tee box. But the stories on this hole never have been told about the guy that took the safe line . . .

Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 453 Yard Par 4 – At 453 yards this two-shotter protected by six bunkers is tough enough, but the real difficulty is the mental distraction the golfer has as he realizes the Playboy Mansion sits beyond the trees behind the green. Uphill all the way to the green, try to stay focused on the task at hand and not the distraction beyond the tall fence."
21,Pebble Beach,"Pebble Beach, CA",Jack Neville/Douglas Grant,1919,PEBBLE BEACH - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev21_pebble_1,"Trying to play golf at some of the best courses in America can be a frustrating experience. Yes, we all know that you can't get a round on Augusta but it seems there are more courses that you can't get a game on than you can. Pebble Beach therefore is a great exception - it's the top rated 'public' course in the USA and while it may be eye-watering expensive at least gives the chance to walk in the steps of legends that so many of us used to playing in Europe take for granted.

The practice putting green was running fast and true so expectations were high on the first tee. Our caddie tried to point me to the gold tees and my friend to the back blues due to our differing handicaps but call us old-fashioned, we decided to both play the same ones. The first hole was a massive disappointment. The fairway was very heavily sanded - and the green was a temporary! Bear in mind this was the most expensive round of golf I had ever paid for. No-one had told us about the condition of the course when booking or before teeing off - ludicrous. I would suggest anyone considering playing asks beforehand what condition the course is in........

The first few holes are nondescript and really do feel like any American country club course. Cart paths, roads and houses making up the most notable features. Now, I should say I played this course some years ago and probably hadn't read up on the course a huge amount before playing. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more with a little preparation but it was a little bit of an underwhelming start.

From there though as you go out to the water the holes are clearly special. The par 5 6th is intimidating on the tee but actually quite playable. By the time we got to the signature par 3 7th the wind was up and yardages were not really much use. A punchy knock down was the order of the day which my partner managed. I put a gap wedge in the air and paid the price as the wind brought it back into the sand. 8 is a fantastic hole - the approach shot over a canyon truly spectacular and the par I got there will stay with me for a long time. 9 and 10 both are wonderful holes, mainly because of the setting, before going back inland.

Golf World go behind the scenes at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

This stretch is probably better than the first few inland holes but you are back in a (very nice) housing estate. The green on the par 5 14th was a bit ridiculous - after coming 572 yards it is pretty small and very angled. 17 and 18 are simply a great finishing two holes and are well documented elsewhere! The wind was up and 17 was playing a rescue for me. 18 is just a wonderful walk up, spoilt for me by a 4 putt to shoot 92. Still, I was an 18 handicapper when I played there so 2 over handicap from the back tees at Pebble was satisfactory!

As an experience Pebble was pretty good. Everyone was friendly and the caddy just fine. The day was slightly spoilt by the sanded fairways and very inconsistent greens. Some were slow, some were fast and it was a question of having a guess when you got there.

But I couldn't help feeling that there wasn't as much 'special' at Pebble Beach as I had hoped for and seen in the true great courses. The holes on the ocean make the course, but the rest are at times nondescript. The round we had was a long one - almost 6 hours - and it felt like we were in a bit of a money-making machine.

Overall though I'm glad we played it. We enjoyed the views and there were some memories there to savour but I imagine there are courses with lesser reputations which will beat this when it comes to my all-time favourite courses. Still, at least you can get a round here without having to been one of the US elite so that's something.

 

BOOKING THE COURSE

Ah, welcome to the money making machine which is Pebble Beach.  Since I played there inflation has hit hard and the green fee for 18 holes at Pebble Beach is a staggering $625 plus cart fee and/or caddie fee. However, booking a tee time is far from straightforward for this much famed ‘public’ course. Because, you see, only guests of the hotel can book a tee time more than 24 hours out. Therefore if you want to guarantee a time on the course you need to stay there. Oh and there’s more, a minimum of a 2 night stay is required to book a round on Pebble – this rises to 3 nights at peak times. Now there are other courses there but given the cheapest room is normally around $1100 a night this is a fabulously expensive trip.

What I should say however, is that the rules seem to be broken. We called up about a week in advance and they gave us a tee time. Maybe that was because the course was pretty roughed up at the time and it would be harder in the peak months but it’s worth a go. You can get a sense of what availability looks like here.

TOUR TIPS

If you do make it to Pebble I would really encourage you to watch a few highlight reels from US Opens gone by to really appreciate the history as you go around. I visited in 1992 as a student when Tom Kite won in the winds and rain and it is just one of the many highlights from over the years worth having a look at.

We stayed in Carmel for a week and there is plenty to do around the area – great drives, the Monterey aquarium, amazing beaches. It’s only a couple of hours south of San Francisco but it was a few years ago now and much will have changed so instead of giving any real local tips, here’s some thoughts of other courses to play in the area..

The Links at Spanish Bay – Part of the Pebble Beach estate. We played it early one morning and it was a 14 at best. Lots of random red stakes everywhere and tight as anything. Avoid!!

Pacific Grove – A local course which I would play every time ahead of Spanish Bay. Can't complain at all for $35! The first 9 were nothing special but the condition was pretty good and pace of play not too bad. The holes were pretty short and very playable. The back 9 opened up on the ocean fantastically - really lovely holes that with the 40 mph wind were playing really tricky. I had a 360 yard drive on one par 4 to the green followed by 200 yards into the wind at the next."
22,Pebble Beach,"Pebble Beach, CA",Jack Neville/Douglas Grant,1919,Review: Pebble Beach Golf Links,Andrew Harvie,rev22_pebble_2,"Given the high-profile nature of Pebble Beach Golf Links, it becomes difficult to present this review as anything other than a typical walkthrough of one of the three most famous golf courses in the world (alongside Augusta National and The Old Course). However, my first and only round at Pebble Beach in December 2023 left a lot to be uncovered by being on property. Sure, hundreds of rounds on my Playstation or Trackman, and the numerous US Open’s and the regular occurrence of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am yearly on the TOUR meant I knew ~roughly what I was getting into. Yet, the old Jack Neville and Douglas Grant design unveiled enough to make me compelled to write a good ‘ol fashioned review.

This opening hole, to such an esteemed golf course, is one that leaves quite a bit to be desired. In truth, it would be among the least exciting holes of any Top 20 golf course in America. A simple tee shot, with less-than-driver to the corner of this sub-400 yard par 4 from the back tees is a fairly mundane opening shot.


I did appreciate the approach shot’s difficulty given the short nature of the hole. Bailing out left off the tee means a longer shot, while everyone plays from a right-handed hanging lie. The greens at Pebble are notoriously small, and this one lives up the hype: not a lot of room for missing, but if you ought to miss, dumping it in the bunker right is the best play. I found this green to be relatively mush, but the back portion features a bit of interest.


Much is made about the dichotomy between the oceanside and inland holes at Pebble Beach, notably the sharp contrast in quality. Granted, it would be difficult for any golf course or property to follow up the stretch from the 4th through the 10th, but the 2nd is a standout inland. At 509 yards, this hole is a converted par 4 for the US Open, but for resort guests, a short par 5 awaits.


What TV won’t show you is the severity of this fairway, which slopes pretty hard towards the ocean on the right. Ideally, one aims at the right edge of the left bunker and gravity will take the ball to the centre. In my group, two people landed at the right edge of the right greenside bunkers (above) with a slight fade and they ended up in the bunkers on the right—cool!

For those laying up, it is a relatively straightforward shot as long as you play short of the (great hazard? Barranca?) trench running east-west on the line of play about 100 yards from the green.


Said trench from the layup area. The two cypress trees left and right make it a very precise layup, something I feel is missed in the modern game.


At 397 yards, the 3rd was the hole I was most curious about given how awkward it is on Trackman. A sharp dogleg left tumbling down the hill towards the ocean across that same trench/barranca, I found this to be a thrilling golf hole and woefully overlooked against the ocean holes. The tee shot tempts the golfer to smash it over the trees if possible, but if not, out to the right and having a hard approach shot from a very difficult downhill right-handed hook lie awaits.


What you have to negotiate with off the tee:


A fairly straightforward approach shot, if not for the difficult lie under the golfer’s feat awaits.


The 4th is the start of a brilliant stretch of oceanside golf, with the Pacific Ocean flanking the entire stretch from the 4th-10th on the right side. The 333 yard two-shot hole is shockingly uphill in person, and probably one of the biggest surprises against the preconceived notions of Pebble Beach prior to playing.


One thing that was disappointing is the mow lines following the US Women’s Open, which have been brought in from the left so that left pot-ish bunker is not a centreline bunker. The entire strategy of the hole benefits those playing out to the right closer to the ocean with the green canted to the right, but losing that fairway feels like a big miss. Nonetheless, a classy hole with a very uphill approach shot tough to control in the coastal winds.


Decent view from here, too:


The 189 yard par 3, 5th is a new Jack Nicklaus par 3, where the old hole played more directly towards the 6th tee. Essentially, you would play away from the ocean, rather than parallel to it as you do now. There are reverse redan elements, but I found this to be a bit of a letdown par 3 given how small the green is.


It is obviously an improvement over the old product… until you have to walk back to the 6th tee. However! The old hole looks rather, vanilla, so I can appreciate Jack’s interest in creating something unique, and I do think it has its own individualistic identity within the set of one-shot holes.

Beginning with the 498 yard par 5, 6th, the stretch ending at the 10th is likely the singular best four-hole stretch in golf. If it isn’t, I cannot wait to find it! When I played, the tee shot was slightly botched given the new mow lines make the ocean a long way right, but I was a bit surprised how narrow the chute between the bunkers and the Pacific was. A difficult tee shot, and one you NEED to get in the fairway.


TV cameras and video games do not do this second shot justice. It is so severely uphill it is hard to believe in person, and is a true thrill to hit in person. Hit and hope!


Here is a picture for scale of two average sized men:


The open nature of the green and the ground welcomes the running shot, meaning those going for it have the thrill of getting home in two looming over them with a good approach (if they can get it over the cliff).


The 107 yard par 3, 7th, in all its glory:


One thing about Pebble Beach that is somewhat of an annoyance is the green complexes. While they are small and that’s cool, there is very little contour in them, meaning a majority of the putts on any round are primarily flat. The same issue is prevalent at Bethpage Black, where the layout is absolutely awesome, but the green complexes are rather mundane and dare I say boring. If you expanded them out 20% and added a bit more contour in the spirit of the original golf course, I suspect Pebble would jump back into the Top 10 in the United States… likely where it belongs and should get back to.

At 416 yards, the 8th is a beefy golf hole given the forced layup of about 250 or so yards from the back tee. This is a difficult tee shot to figure out where to go, I know I had no idea. I hit it over the corner of the fescue on the left and was in the middle of the fairway, but with proper mow lines, the eye gets pulled pretty far right.


The approach to the 8th, as difficult as cool as advertised… and quite downhill.


For those laying up or unable to make it on the direct route, there is room left to bail out. The price of admission is worth it alone for this singular hole. Sublime!


A cool look back shows how dramatic the approach shot is:


The ninth hole is an absolute terror-infused 483 yards, with a very severe fairway waiting balls that land in the fairway. Anything between the bunkers on the left of the 9th fairway and the left edge of the bunkers in the distance at the 10th is a great line. Like the 6th and 8th, getting the ball in the fairway is paramount to the success of playing this hole properly. There are few golf courses that demand such accuracy, and the rough was not long!


From a right-handed hanging downhill lie, this is among the more difficult approach shots you will ever hit. That ocean might be out to the right, but it is MUCH more in play than it looks.


I wish I would have played the 444 yard par 4, 10th from the original tee down on the right, but I suspect that is likely frowned upon. Regardless, the 10th’s fairway is severely sloped to the right, rewarding a tee shot just right of the bunkers up the left. Another spectacular hole, but a (very) small step down against the 8th and 9th.


Another difficult approach from the consistent hanging lie, though this one has a bit of room to run the ball in, at least for those who challenge the ocean up the right.


I suggest taking a look back from behind the 10th green to admire the stretch of coastline golf you just played.


There is a fair amount of discourse about the merits of the 370 yard par 4, 11th and how it follows the stretch of golf along the coast, but I actually enjoyed this hole. Most great golf courses are anything but prototypical, and the 11th is that unusual spice that makes it what it is. A tee shot left of the mansion is ideal. For those keeping track, this is the third blind tee shot in four holes—I, for one, love the funk!


The severe uphill nature of the hole continues on the approach shot, and also plays to a severe back-to-front green. Finally, a green that makes me feel something!


The 12th is an abysmal 202 yard par 3. Playing slightly downhill, this… THIS, is the letdown after a pretty brilliant stretch of golf. I am not certain now anyone over a 3 index plays this hole, but good on you if you can. The green is likely too small and the sand splash coming from the bunker short left makes it borderline impossible to get it close without a 130 foot apex.


I loved the 401 yard par 4, 13th, another severe fairway but the first hole since the 3rd that it features a right-handed hook lie. I enjoyed the green here as well, with the back right portion being pretty demanding but the opening in the front allowing the higher-handicap to get it close. Anyways, from the back tee, getting it over the bunker jutting in on the left is not a cakewalk, so I imagine if the wind was different I would have to play out right and let the slope funnel the ball around the bunker.


A pretty neat, yet demanding uphill approach with everything dramatically sloping towards the Pacific Ocean on the left.


The 14th is a bit of a slog at 559 yards, turning uphill and to the right around the course’s boundary. The tee shot is unusual: unlike the 9th or 11th, where the achievement is simply avoiding choas on the opening swing, there are bunkers littering the landing area, meaning repeat plays are probably preferred to be able to figure out the exact line.


The aforementioned bunkers:


Good for you if you can get home in two here, most can;t, meaning this layup is rather lame.


The cypress tree on the right was a surprise, pushing most to the left of the fairway meaning the massive greenside bunker short left comes into play more. Kinda neat in that respect, but if you can get it down far enough, it doesn’t really matter. Even from the right, the false front right of the greenside bunker is equally as difficult.


I have a lot of time for the 393 yard par 4, 15th, a very fun tee shot to slam down the hillside with the bunkering up the left lingering.


The bunkering does make this a fairly difficult tee shot, but getting it down far enough means it likely won’t matter too much. I wonder if anyone has ever gotten into the greenside bunkers with their tee shots… I was about 65 yards from the front edge, and there are much longer players than me. I asked the two caddies in my group but they didn’t know. Someone call Kyle Birkshire!


The approach is relatively straightforward, but this is a subtle, good green.

I also loved the 400 yard par 4, 16th, which was likely the inland hole I was most excited to see prior to playing. Anything left of the Cypress Tree centre frame is ideal. The fairway does pinch pretty aggressively, so three wood or even less might be the play if it was firmer.


This approach shot is gorgeous, splitting the two cypress trees with some pretty artistic bunkering short.


If anything, I felt the famed 182 yard penultimate hole at Pebble Beach to be a slight letdown, mostly held up by history and its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. I think it’s a ~fine golf hole, but nothing more really. In general, the par 3’s at Pebble Beach are shockingly weak considering the status of the golf course, with only the 7th being a standout and largely off its location, not off its architectural merits.


The green’s shape was cool though!


The 18th was anything but a disappointment however, and a worthy finish to any golf course (but especially Pebble Beach). Credit where its due, English architect Herbert Strong extended the hole by some 200 yards, turning it into the par 5 it is today. At 541 yards, the hole is just reachable enough that playing closer to the Pacific means you might stand a chance at getting greenside in two, but just long enough that bailing out right makes it a tougher three-shot hole.


Anything left of the tree is pretty good. Missing right means you have to negociate with it (like I had to).


The green is small, but I think a good tee shot would allow the chance to get home in two if you were aggressive up the left. The bunkering against the sea wall makes the layup pretty awkward, especially trying to avoid the tree overhanging the right bunkers.


Is Pebble the single best public golf course in the United States? Probably not in my mind. For starters, the green complexes, especially in contrast to a Pinehurst No. 2 or Pacific Dunes, are lacking and among the top 20 golf courses in America, likely the least interesting set around. With that being said, it might be the most exciting golf course I’ve played tee-to-green, and for that, Pebble still deserves the utmost recognition among the world of golf.

Lots has been made about the price of a green fee here, and more specifically, if it is worth it. AT $625 USD, I would say yes, but if the rumours are true about the $1,000 green fee in 2025, likely not at that rate, especially if I could, in theory, play all five golf courses in two days at Bandon for that price (first round full price, second round half, third round free).


With all that being said, Pebble Beach is still epic, but I wish Pebble Beach Company would explore a restoration to bring back some of the classic features lost. If that happened, who knows how high Pebble would rank… for now, I think it is on the outside of the top 10-15 looking in."
23,Pinehurst (No. 2),"Village of Pinehurst, NC",Donald Ross,1907,Pinehurst No. 2: Donald Ross’ Crowning Achievement,Sean Ogle,rev23_pinehurst_1,"I thought my golf season was over for the year – or at least the quest for top 100 courses.

That is until I got an email inviting me to a business conference in Charlotte, North Carolina in October.

It’d prove to be easy to tack onto the end of my trip to New York City, so I figured why not.


Of course, that easy two days quickly devolved into a full week after I realized that Pinehurst was a short 2 hour drive from where I’d be staying.

Simply put Pinehurst #2 is one of the most famous and history-rich courses in the world. It’s hosted nearly every major tournament and considering both the men and women’s US Opens were played just a few months before, it seemed like the perfect time to make the trip over.

I honestly wasn’t totally sure what to expect. I’d only played a couple rounds of golf ever in the Southeast, and I really knew nothing about what the town would be like.

The night before I was to switch over to my room at the Carolina Hotel I was at the Best Western in Southern Pines. A perfectly fine hotel for those on a budget, but it simply didn’t compare to what I’d soon be experiencing at the Carolina.

It was a short 10 minute drive to get to Pinehurst, but once there it felt a world away.  I was leaving strip mall central and then winding my way through neighborhoods trying to find the hotel.

Then out of nowhere I took a left hand turn and was greeted by the famous “Pinehurst” shrub in front of the hotel.

Carolina Hotel


Sidenote: There must be a higher concentration of golf courses within 20 minutes of Pinehurst, than anywhere else in the world. They. Are. Everywhere.

For some reason I had it in my head that the resort would be a little more like Bandon in the sense that once you’re in the resort, you’re in. Not the case. The resort and courses of Pinehurst seamlessly blend in with the small community around it – if I had to draw a comparison, it was probably more similar to Blackwolf Run and Kohler than any of the other golf destinations I’ve been to.

I got checked into the beautiful hotel, and was greeted with extraordinarily friendly service everywhere I went (must be a southern thing).

I hopped the shuttle to make the short transfer over to the main clubhouse where courses #1-5 sat.

Walking through the clubhouse was like getting a history lesson, seeing the photos, memorabilia and everything else that goes along with having so much history attached to the place.

After checking in and walking out of the pro shop, I strolled around the back of the clubhouse taking it in. The putting green, the Payne Stewart statue, the first tee.

Anytime I play a new course, especially one as highly revered as Pinehurst #2, you can’t help but get a little giddy.

I’ve traveled all over the world, and while I won’t say I’m jaded by any means, I have found that playing a new course like this gets me more excited than just about anything else.

I can only imagine how it’ll feel once I finally get to play the likes of Augusta or Cypress 🙂

I also learned that Pinehurst is actually a country club. I didn’t realize that there was a membership component to the course, but it was pretty clear it was due to the “members only” section of the deck at the back of the clubhouse.

I hit the range and then headed to the practice green where I met the three other guys I’d be playing with.  One of them was a sales guy and a pretty decent golfer. The other two were separate clients he’d just signed – and neither of them looked like they’d played golf in years – if ever.


At least I wouldn’t be the worst person on the course today, I thought to myself.

Little did I know just how special of a day it would end up being.

The Front Nine at Pinehurst No. 2

The other gentlemen I was playing with elected to take a cart, which I thought to be the stupidest decision of all time.

You’re playing #2 for the first (probably only) time ever, and the course is cart path only. So not only do you spend just as much (if not more) time walking than me, but you miss out on a large part of the experience.

I elected to take a caddie, which I rarely do if I don’t have to, but I felt it only appropriate. And it was a great decision, as he was excellent, and easily shaved some strokes off my round.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 375 yards)

Not wanting to embarrass myself, I left the driver in the bag and stepped up to the tee with my three wood, the length on the first isn’t it’s major defense.


Right down the middle.

The hole is deceptively difficult as the fairway closes with bunkers right around the landing area.  As was the case with many of the courses I played in the region, all the bunkers on the course were played as waste bunkers -and thus, you could ground your club.

I left my 6 iron to 15 feet, and as I walked up to the green I could see exactly what made this course so famous – and diabolical. The entire outside of the green sloped from the center out. Meaning, if you didn’t hit your spot – you’re screwed.

I asked my caddie if all the greens were this tough and he just said “psh, this an easy one.”

Great.

I walked off feeling ecstatic about me par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 1


Hole 2 (Par 4, 410 yards)

The second is one of the most difficult holes on one of the most difficult courses you’ll find.

During the open it could stretch to over 500 yards…as a par 4.

It’s far too easy to find yourself in the trees or the waste bunker on the left off the tee, and if you are you’ll have a tough time making par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 2 Pinehurst 2 - Hole 2 Approach


Hole 3 (Par 4, 317 yards)

I really liked the third hole.

A short par 4 with a dogleg right to an elevated green. However, take one look at the green complex, and you’ll be intimidating.

The green is narrow and wide, and it just looks like it slopes off in every direction.

I knew that I’d be having the golf gods looking down on me during the round after I left my approach in the right bunker, then hitting out of the san my ball hit the pin and dropped down to a foot away – allowing me to save my par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 3


Hole 4 (Par 5, 482 yards)

There was a little confusion on the course as to whether the 4th was a par 4 or par 5. The reality is that for the championships it was changed from a par 5 to a par 4. And the 5th was changed from a par 4 to a par 5.

I’m still not sure what this one technically was when I played it…

Either way, despite radically different scenery, this hole reminded me of the 14th at Trump International. It’s obvious which one would have influenced the other, but with the tee position, elevation, and bunkering there were many resemblances.

The main defense here was a tricky green that sloped hard right to left.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 4 Pinehurst 2 - Hole 4 Approach


Hole 5 (Par 4, 431 yards)

Long known as one of the most fearsome par 4s in the game, I found it to be a very tame par 5.

Note: We played this around 480 yards, and I believe as a par 5. However, I’m still unsure…

This would be true for many of the par 5s at Pinehurst #2 actually.

I recently heard Tiger Woods talking about how the course is a great example of a course that can be tremendously difficult for the pros, but still totally playable for the amateur.

I won’t lie, the course was not nearly as difficult as I was expecting it to be – playing from the white tees of 6300 yards. Yes the greens were pretty intimidating, but I was able to go for it in 2 on nearly all of the par 5s – which I wasn’t expecting.

After leaving my approach 3 wood short in the bunker, I chipped it up to 10 feet and left myself with another tap in par. Something that was a bit of a theme for the first half of the round.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 5


Hole 6 (Par 3, 179 yards)

The 6th is a long par 3 with a large green and two massive waste bunkers on either side of it. One cool feature is the fact that the tee box backs up right against the new back teebox for #4. Looking down the 4th fairway from there really puts into perspective how much longer the course can be when the pros play it.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 6


Hole 7 (Par 4, 377 yards)

The 7th is a sharp dogleg right, and depending on where you put your drive, you can have a considerable carry over the waste bunkers at the corner. These were all new during the recent renovation, and my short 3 wood wasn’t nearly enough to even get close to thinking about making it over any of them off the tee.

With wider fairways than it used to have, driver may have been the play – but either way I still walked away with a solid par.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 7 Approach Small

Fun fact: There’s a HUGE house on the 7th fairway that is owned by the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. My caddie said the place get’s used once a year at most. More interesting than that though is the fact the guy bought part of the outfield wall from Yankee Stadium and it now sits in his driveway.

I couldn’t help but sneak over to take a photo…

Hole 8 (Par 5, 457 yards)

The par 5 8th is another example of a par 5 that just seemed way too easy. It only measured 456 yards, and was basically just a straight shot uphill to the green.

At this point I had a pretty good score going, and I left my second shot just short of the green and proceeded to three putt it from there. I still made par, but being that close on a par 5 and not walking away with better was frustrating.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 8


Hole 9 (Par 3, 151 yards)

For some reason this was the hole that’s always stuck out in my mind.  The par 3 9th was the one that I was most excited to play, and walking up to it, I was also only three over and feeling pretty great about the round so far.

It’s not a long hole at only 148 yards from where we were, but the bunkering and green undulation is easily some of the most severe you’ll see on the course.

I stepped up, hit my shot, and I swear I thought it was going to go in the hole. It was right in line with the pin, and it looked like a tap in birdie from the tee.

The reality was it was about 10 feet out, and I missed the putt – but once again, I’ll take tap in pars all day long on a course like this.

The Back Nine at Pinehurst No. 2

Hole 10 (Par 5, 469 yards)

This is another example of someone up above looking down on me. As I made the turn with a 39 on the front, I couldn’t help but say to myself “how cool would it be to break 80 on Pinehurst #2?!”

I stepped up to the tee of what ended up being another remarkably short dogleg left par 5, and what did I do? Duck hooked it, hard into the trees to the left.

As I turned around to walk back, my caddie just starts laughing.

“Clean living, man.”

“What?”

“Your ball hit the tree and bounced back out to the middle of the fairway”

My second shot was a three wood just to the right of the green and I chipped up and two-putted for par.

It’s worth noting some of these holes play much longer if you step back to the blue tees, in this case it would be a 100 yards farther back…

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 10


Hole 11 (Par 4, 368 yards)

Ben Hogan reportedly called the 11th one of his favorite par 4s, and with the recent restoration, it was restored to the way it looked and played back in his day.

A mid-length to long par 4 (depending on the tees), it has a feature found on many of the holes at Pinehurst #2 in that the green is just slightly off center of the fairway. You rarely have a straight shot to the green.  It’s often slightly off to the right, and surrounded by bunkers, forcing you to think a little bit more about what shot you’re going to hit.

They’ve added waste bunker all down the right, and while it was relatively tame during my time there, I can only imagine how scary they let it get for the majors.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 11


Hole 12 (Par 4, 351 yards)

Remember that slightly off-center green we talked about at 11? Well, 12 has the same thing, but much more pronounced.

Ideally, you’ll want to find the right side of the fairway for the shortest approach. Be careful not to go long on that shot either, because the back of the green has a pretty tight lie and significant run off the back – as I learned the hard way.

I had my first double in awhile, and I could slowly feel the round slipping away from me.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 12 Green

Hole 13 (Par 4, 356 yards)

I found 13 to be a welcome change of pace.

So far the back nine had been great, but 13 added a little bit of elevation and visual interest to the course.



A dogleg right with a significantly elevated green that sweeps back a bit to the left, this hole had a little hint of Tobacco Road in it which I really enjoyed.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 13

Hole 14 (Par 4, 400 yards)

It was right around this time that we realized just how slow we’d really been playing.  Our caddie told us we had about an hour of light left, and honestly, at that point I was about ready to forge ahead from my group (as there was no one in front of us anymore).

But we all agreed to pick it up a bit, and I crossed my fingers.

14 is one of those holes where you really feel like you can step up and rip it. It’s a straightaway par 4, but as with many of the holes, you need to be wary of bunker outcroppings around the landing area.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 14



Hole 15 (Par 3, 169 yards)

The first par 3 on the backside, the 15th is a straight forward par 3 with a large round green, and some deep menacing bunkers flanking it. However like most of the holes here, Ross’ signature crowned greens are in full force, waiting to knock your ball off the dance floor.

Overall with the exception of #9, I was slightly underwhelmed by the par 3s on the course. Sure, there was nothing wrong with them, but I felt they lacked a bit of interest and wow factor.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 15



Hole 16 (Par 5, 469 yards)

Ok, now these par 5s are getting a little ridiculous. Either that, or I’m just playing from the wrong tee boxes. This one comes in at 456 yards, and I believe is the first and only time that water comes into play on the course.

In two shots I’m just off the green, and after a tumultuous couple holes before it, I make my par and walk away.

This actually played as a par 4 during the US Open, and at 489 yards, is just 3 yards shorter than the blue tees which play it as a par 5.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 16

Hole 17 (Par 3, 155 yards)

At this point it was near dark, and we were hurrying to get the round in. I don’t know if it was the light or Donald Ross playing tricks on us, but no one could seem to dial it in to get the right distance on this hole.



Pretty much anywhere not on the green is in trouble.

Pinehurst 2 - Hole 17

Hole 18 (Par 4, 382 yards)

What’s there to say about #18? Well, I’m not totally sure, as I could barely see it when I played 🙂

I will say walking down the 18th fairway to where Payne Stewart made that championship-winning putt in 1999 was a pretty remarkable feeling. You can clearly imagine all of the grandstands, and cheering, and I imagine no matter how many times you play it – it would never get old.

I ended up having a 12 foot putt to save par, and tie the best round of my life with an 81.

In near darkness, I stepped up to the ball, visualized my line, and rolled it in, completing what is easily one of the most memorable rounds of my life.



Pinehurst 2 - Hole 18

Final Thoughts on Pinehurst #2

Despite not being in love with the par 3s, I actually liked the course more than I was expecting to.

I can hear you now “It’s ranked so high, and has so much history! How could you expect not to like it?”

I’ve come to find, that it’s rarely the classic, championship, true-test-of-golf courses that are my favorites.

Why?

Well for one, because they’re hard!

But on top of that, I like holes that are memorable, quirky, unique, and most importantly fun.


Many courses similar to Pinehurst (Oakland Hills, Olympic Club, etc.) are incredible to play because of the history and prestige but don’t have quite the same wow factor as some other courses.

With all of that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Pinehurst #2. It lived up to expectations, and the greens were honestly unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. Luckily my speed was pretty much on for the day, as I only had one birdie, but numerous tap in pars.

Simply put, this is a pilgrimage every golfer has to make at some point in their lives. Is it a cheap round? Absolutely not. Is it one you and your buddies will talk about for the rest of your lives? You bet.

And luckily, even though this round may very well be the most expensive one of your life, Pinehurst Resort has 8 other incredible courses that are each unique, more affordable, and potentially, even more enjoyable as a recreational golfer."
24,Pinehurst (No. 2),"Village of Pinehurst, NC",Donald Ross,1907,"Pinehurst Resort No.2 (Pinehurst, North Carolina)",Bill Satterfield,rev24_pinehurst_2,"The history at Pinehurst needs little introduction. From being the cradle of American golf to Payne Stewart’s famous U.S. Open win to being the first course to host the men’s and women’s U.S. Open back to back, the No.2 course at Pinehurst is a bucket list course for any golf aficionado. No.2 features some of the strongest shot values on the planet and there is no part of your game that it doesn’t test. From punishing length to deadly accuracy to exacting finesse, you have to have your ‘A’ game going all day to conquer the mighty No.2. Its famous domed greens look big, but the effective landing areas are small with the slightest miscalculation being punished to the fullest extent of the law. If there is some forgiveness to be had it is off the tee as the fairways are more generous now than before the Coore & Crenshaw renovation. Instead of the thick rough found in the previous century, fairways were expanded and waste areas were exposed outside of the short grass. When the course is running firm though, the lack of rough can result in precarious lies where luck is the biggest factor after a ball chases through the fairway. There isn’t a lot of movement in the terrain at No.2 except for a brief stretch on each nine, which is nice for walking but not quite as engaging while playing. Speaking of walking, there are no carts on No.2 with players being required to walk with, or without, a caddie. Ultimately Pinehurst rides its history to its lofty rankings on the major magazines lists, but is still worth dropping the coin on for one loop around while making sure to take some of the resort’s other courses in as well.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  18th Hole – 451 Yard Par 4 – Standing on the final tee at Pinehurst there is a lot going on. There is the emotion of playing the last hole of the day, the challenge of a 451 yard uphill two-shotter, the history of those that have come before you, and tons of trouble to find as a massive waste bunker crosses in front of the tee and works its way up the right side. Bunkers provide a wall of defense in front of the elevated green and demand a high, soft approach shot. The 18th hole is a perfect example of what Pinehurst is all about. Demanding, yet fair, tee shots followed up by a more demanding approach shot. #2 is simply a shot makers course, which by #18 you will be well aware of!

18th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (451 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 191 Yards – When you come to Pinehurst you should have one expectation above anything else; challenging greens. The course that is perhaps the most demanding approach shot course in the world boasts green complexes that will test every aspect of your short game and the 9th is a good example of it. The right third of the green slopes off the edges while the rest of the green is mostly surrounded by bunkering. Anything that doesn't find the putting surface will require exacting work to save par. The long, thin bunker short of the right side is a lousy spot to be if the pin is on the left third of the green as it leaves an awkward distance to hit precisely from the sand. This hole is one of the most striking visual holes since the restoration.

9th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (191 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  8th Hole – 502 Yards – A very strong two-shotter, the 8th plays as a par four from the tips and a par five from the closer tees. The tee shot plays from a natural rise in the terrain down to a sunken fairway before climbing back up to the raised greensite. Tee shots up the left side that bring the trees into play but can be rewarded with a speed slot that will generate some extra distance. The classic Ross domed green here makes it difficult to get close to the flag, especially if you are trying to get close to a rear pin placement when balls can trickle off the back and leave a brutal up and down scenario. While the front of the green is open for approaches on the ground or in the air, it is one of the most challenging greens to hit in regulation and a cracker of a hole.

8th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (502 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  5th Hole – 576 Yards – For years the 5th hole at Pinehurst #2 was one of the most celebrated par fours in North Carolina, and with good reason. However, the hole played as a par five in the original design and up until the 1951 Ryder Cup when it was converted to a brutal two-shotter. It was lengthened and reintroduced as a par five leading into the 2014 U.S. Opens while the 4th hole, formerly a par five, was reduced to a par four. This big par five doglegs to the left around a waste area while trees line the right side. The fairway slopes from right to left and it will take about 300 yards to clear the bunker on the left side if you try to shorten the hole. The green complex is one of the most brilliant designs anywhere and requires absolute precision when playing it. The edges around the green are quick to repel shots that don't approach with sufficient energy and bunkers lie in wait to create more grief. From the lower bunker on the left there is hope of getting up and down with a spinning sand shot that makes it high enough onto the putting surface to hold, but from the high bunker on the right it will take Tour level skill to get up and down. There are no pin placements within seven paces of the perimeter of the green due to the severity of the slope and it will take all of your game and strategy to come out on top here.

5th Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (576 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  3rd Hole – 387 Yard Par 4 – There are plenty of punishing holes at Pinehurst, so taking advantage of this early gift is paramount. The hole plays across flat ground to a generous fairway where only 250 yards is needed to stay short of the fairway bunker on the right and set up a wedge into the green. Aggressive players may try to clear the fairway bunkers and drive it up to a chipping area left of the green. The green isn't as severe as others on the course so players can attack pins with more confidence. During the 2014 U.S. Open this hole yielded more birdies than any other, except for the par five 4th (which used to be a par four).

3rd Hole at Pinehurst Resort No.2 (387 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  4th Hole – 529 Yard Par 4 – Donald Ross said that championship golf courses, like Pinehurst #2, should “call for long and accurate tee shots, accurate iron play, precise handling of the short game, and finally, consistent putting.” To walk away with a par at the lengthy second hole, at least three of those elements better be spot on. Played as a par five prior to the 2014 U.S. Open, the 4th now stands as Pinehurst's most difficult par four. Tipping out well over 500 yards, the 4th plays from an elevated tee to a fairway that steadily turns to the left the entire way to the hole. Waste bunkers are found randomly along the outside of the fairway in conjunction with the 1940s version of the hole and more bunkers are featured left and right of the green. The putting surface tilts hard right to left and acts as the hole’s biggest defense; as if the length wasn't tough enough already. The swell in front of the green is a well used collection area for approaches that don't come in with sufficient juice to climb onto the putting surface. As a par five, it was a hole players looked at as a possible scoring opportunity; as a par four it is a bogey magnet."

Macdonald, 1895/Seth Raynor, 1923",1895,"Chicago Golf Club (Wheaton, Illinois)",Bill Satterfield,rev25_chicago_gc_1,"Chicago Golf Club is one of the most revered clubs in the world, let alone in the United States where it became the first 18 hole course in America and is one of the five original founding clubs of the USGA (Newport CC, Shinnecok Hills, The Country Club in Brookline, MA, and Saint Andrew's in NY being the others). A small membership that is the epitome of ""historic old school"" is what you'll find here with members who know the game, respect the game, and honor its history. There isn't a country club feel at CGC, it is akin to San Francisco Golf Club where it is all about golf. Players walk, take a caddie, and soak in some of the best template holes that C.B. Macdonald ever created, including a set of par threes that only Camargo can rival as the best the Good Doctor ever carved out of the ground. Speaking of the ground, the terrain at CGC is mostly flat with subtle changes throughout the property along the same lines as Kingston Heath and Garden City Golf Club. Despite the flatness, there is no lapse of interest given the brilliance of the architecture, bunker placements, and shaping throughout the putting surfaces. The course length is modest by today's standards tipping out under 6900 yards, but no one at the club is concerned with that; in fact, many members choose to play the middle tees to most closely replicate the experience Macdonald had when he designed the course. The historic club is no stranger to hosting high profile events having welcomed the world's best players for the U.S. Open in 1897, 1900, and 1911 while more recently hosting the Women's Senior U.S. Open in 2018. Chicago Golf Club has also hosted the Walker Cup in 1928 and again in 2005 but has hosted more amateur tournaments than anything else with the U.S. Amateur in 1897, 1905, 1909, and 1912 as well as the Women's U.S. Amateur in 1903 and U.S. Senior Amateur in 1979. Ultimately, an invitation to Chicago Golf Club is an opportunity to be cherished and an experience never to be forgotten.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  3rd Hole – 219 Yard Par 3 – The one-shotters at Chicago Golf Club are of the highest caliber and none are finer than the first; the famous Biarritz. Pin positions are only found in the back third which is perfect considering how well the superintendent maintains nearly ideal firm and fast conditions. After carrying the bunker fronting the target, the tight grass leading up to the putting surface is deft at skipping balls through the chasm and on top of the green where the flag awaits. The green complex is encircled by bunkers and creates a virtual island green, however the sand is shaped thinly enough that big misses will finish in the rough or perhaps in the tree line on the left that creates the club's eastern boundary near the southern end of the property. During a golf tournament, you'd have a hard time dragging me away from watching shot after shot comes into this masterful hole.

3rd Hole at Chicago Golf Club (219 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  7th Hole – 207 Yards – The template hole I see copied more than any other, but rarely nearly as well as what is found at CGC, is Redan. This fantastic rendition boasts a very large putting surface and an obvious slope that is anxious to work your ball toward the flag that will always be found on the left half of the putting surface. With the firm conditions, a very viable play is to hit a low running shot that carries the bunker in front before ascending up the face of the green before swinging left in classic Redan fashion. As is always the case with a good Redan, the bunker fronting the green and angling left with the putting surface is a death trap with a steep face that you want to avoid at all costs. After playing this wonderful and pure rendition of a Redan, you will likely find yourself shaking your head trying to figure out what Tom Doak and Jim Urbina were thinking when they designed their version of Redan as the 12th hole at Old Macdonald; perhaps the worst hole at the entire Bandon Dunes Resort.

7th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (207 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  12th Hole – 462 Yards – I've never played a Punchbowl hole I didn't like, and the 12th at Chicago Golf Club is no exception. Five fairway bunkers are scattered across the short grass enroute to the green which is certainly a factor to consider given how important the second shot is here. Approaches coming in from the left side are ideal as they avoid the deep bunker at the front right of the green while also taking advantage of the slope in the putting surface that can be quick to feed balls near the hole given the drainage slope out the back right. Like most Punchbowl holes, the second shot is coming in from a longer distance than most second shots given the generous sloping of the green and puts a premium on accuracy with those clubs in your bag as missing the putting surface is a costly mistake. The best and most fun hole on the back nine, it is great to see some modern courses implementing Punchbowl designs that embrace the elements CGC shows here.

12th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (462 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 536 Yards – One of only two par fives at the course, Long is considered one of two Cape holes at CGC (14th is the other) though the turn left is fairly slight, but does feature a large boomerang bunker and waste area on the inside of the turn that you'll want to avoid. While the green can be reached in two, it takes a very precise shot in order to clear the false front but not come in so hot that your ball feeds off the back into the horseshoe bunker hugging the putting surface. The elevated green represents one of the largest rises on the property and a moment where a decision has to be made in calculating the firmness of the ground with the slope that wants to repel shots that come up wanting. Even laying up doesn't guarantee a chance to go flag hunting unless it is positioned in the center of the green, because that is the only safe place to aim on this challenging putting surface. Ultimately, this is a high quality par five and an example of what can be done with relatively tame property to work with.

4th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (536 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  5th Hole – 358 Yard Par 4 – Midway through each nine Macdonald offers a short par four to try and take advantage of. On the back nine it is the 351 yard Cape hole with a narrow entrance into the green, and on the front it is the 358 Leven hole. As is typical with Leven holes, a heroic carry is required off the tee for the optimal angle into the green, but here at Chicago Golf Club that carry isn't as challenging as it was originally as the angled cross bunker on the right side requires just 240 yards to clear from the back tee and less than 200 yards from the middle tee. The right half of the green is unobstructed for a shot to run up onto the putting surface while the left side has a bunker that must be flown. Interestingly, the spine in the middle of the green can dictate which side of the fairway you want to attack from and which half of the putting surface to finish on. With the prevailing Chicago winds likely at your back, this is a great opportunity to take a rip at the green and show off your short game to complete the birdie.

5th Hole at Chicago Golf Club (358 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 481 Yard Par 4 – The Road hole is often the most difficult par on a template course and Chicago Golf Club is no different. Within 20 yards of being a 500 yard par four, the 2nd hole will require length and accuracy in order to put up a fair fight. Four fairway bunkers line the left side and creep further toward the center line the farther down the fairway you get. Those bunkers influence golfers to attack the right side of hole, which is the optimal angle into the green, but total precision is needed to make it work as it is easier to end up in the right rough than it is the short grass when carrying the lone bunker on that side. The false front on the right side is ready to deny shots that approach the green with insufficient energy and on the left of course awaits the infamous Road bunker where par saves are few and far between. CGC is known for its difficult starting stretch, and this hole is a key reason why."
26,Chicago GC,"Wheaton, IL","C.B. Macdonald, 1895/Seth Raynor, 1923",1895,Chicago Golf Club,top100golfcourses,rev26_chicago_gc_2,"It’s possible that Chicago acquired its “Windy City” nickname thanks to the cooling summer lake breezes, which funnel their way through the city streets, and it’s also feasible that the great World’s Columbian Exhibition of 1893 was the catalyst for the formation of Chicago Golf Club. After all, the city needed a golf course for the visiting VIPs.

Founded in 1892, Chicago Golf Club was initially located at Belmont. In 1894 it moved to its present location at Wheaton and it became the first 18-hole course in America, designed by the daddy of American golf course architecture, Charles Blair Macdonald.

Chicago Golf Club has a number of firsts to write home about. In 1897 it was the first club outside the Northeast to host the US Open and it was also the first club to employ bent grass greens. Chicago was also one of the five founder members of the American Golf Association, which was subsequently renamed the USGA. The other four charter members were: Newport Country Club, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, St. Andrew's Golf Club (Yonkers, N.Y.), and The Country Club.

George Bahto commented as follows in The Evangelist of Golf : “Macdonald’s original design was not dramatically altered for over 20 years with the exception of a few suggestions by famed British architect Harry Colt. With new and better courses popping up all the time, the architect of Sunningdale, at the club’s request, tweaked the design to help keep the quality of the course competitive with some of the more modern layouts. Ultimately though, Chicago Golf Club’s design became antiquated and the club voted in 1922 to retain Macdonald’s legendary protégé, Seth Raynor, to assist Macdonald in completely remodeling the layout.”

The club staged many early championships, including the US Amateur, US Open and the Walker Cup. In 1928, Bobby Jones was the Walker Cup playing captain and he posted an amazing course record 66, which drove team USA to an emphatic 11-1 victory. The Walker Cup returned to Chicago for the second time in 2005.

Chicago Golf Club is one of America’s most exclusive golf clubs and today it is still intensely private, but if you’ve been lucky enough to play this famous course, we’d love to read your review."
27,Riviera,"Pacific Palisades, CA",George Thomas Jr./Billy Bell Sr.,1927,Riviera,top100golfcourses,rev27_riviera_1,"The 18-hole layout at Riviera Country Club is undoubtedly an important course, not just because of its magnetic appeal to many famous members, including Glen Campbell, Dean Martin, and Gregory Peck, but also because this is a masterpiece in architectural design.

George C. Thomas Jr. designed Riviera, or should we say manufactured Riviera. When the course opened for play in 1926, the construction bill was almost $250,000 and this was one of the first courses where literally the earth moved in mysterious ways. Thomas was perhaps the most underrated architect of his time and much of his work has been lost through the perennial remodeling programs and the same is true to a greater extent here at Riviera. Fortunately some holes do still play in the strategic spirit that Thomas intended where he who dares and wins will be rewarded.

Riviera was one of Ben Hogan’s favourite courses and it’s sometimes referred to as “Hogan’s Alley”. Perhaps so named because Hogan took the tight but more rewarding driving line here at Riviera, just as he did on the 5th hole at Carnoustie during the 1953 Open. We suspect it may be because it was here that Hogan set his Open record of 276 or perhaps it was because he made his historic comeback at Riviera after his horrific car crash in 1950. Does anybody know?

Hogan declared that Riviera's one-shot 4th Redan is ""The greatest Par 3 hole in America"" and his statement is commemorated by a plaque stating: ""In 1987, the 4th hole at Riviera Country Club was chosen by Mr. Hogan as the site for filming his club company's commercials. It was the only time his golf swing was ever seen in the Hogan commercials.""

The Los Angeles Open was first played at Riviera Country Club in 1929, but the event began a long-term relationship with the club in 1973. Since 1973, The LA Open has been played here every year except 1983 and 1988 when Riviera played host to the PGA Championship and the U.S. Senior Open respectively. Jack Nicklaus pocketed his first pay packet here at Riviera in the 1962 LA Open. His 50th place banked him a modest $33 but the Riviera Country Club remained one of the few PGA Tour courses where the Golden Bear never claimed a victory.

There are few layouts with no weaknesses, but Riviera might be one. It’s undoubtedly a special course that's routed across less than ideal terrain. We therefore doff our caps to Mr Thomas."
28,Riviera,"Pacific Palisades, CA",George Thomas Jr./Billy Bell Sr.,1927,RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev28_riviera_2,"Riviera Country Club (or ‘Riv’ as those in the know would have it) is one of American’s most famous golf courses. It’s one of the few places with an enduring event on the PGA Tour. The LA Open was first held here in 1929 and over 75 iterations of the event have been held there since. On top of that, the US Open and the USPGA have both visited and 2028 will bring the Olympics, ensuring Riviera stays firmly in the golf spotlight.

When George Thomas finished the course he declared it his greatest achievement (although it should be noted that this was a common refrain from him!). Once again (cf. Bel Air) imagination was the key to his success. In his definitive account of George Thomas, ‘The Captain’, Geoff Shackelford says, ‘There is little question that Riviera is one of the greatest golf course constructions of all time’. 

This is because the site itself is basically a flat, featureless, canyon valley. There’s not a huge amount of elevation change at Riviera other than the first tee shot and climb up to the 18th.There is a wash running through the middle and that’s about it for natural features. Everything else we see on the course was shaped by Thomas and his team. These days that wouldn’t be such an amazing feat. Modern courses are scooped out of flat sites regularly, as technology has developed. However, in 1927 this was quite an achievement, and the reason the record high $250,000 cost was about three times of that of a normal build of the time.

Most readers will be very familiar with Riviera from the annual TV coverage and it has some of the most iconic holes in the world of professional golf. Here are some of the highlights from my visit to Riviera, as well as some tips for how to get a round. Unlike at most of America’s private courses, the route to playing here is relatively easy (if expensive).

Enjoy the First Tee Experience
Riviera is one of the few courses where everyone gets an announcement on the first tee. When I was there it was a slightly overcast day, and there had been a bit of drizzle in the morning. As a result the place was empty - the only other person around was member, and fellow West Ham supporter, Francesco Molinari working on his putting nearby. What would have counted as a fairly nice day in the east of Scotland had scared all the members away. That didn’t stop the starter clearing his throat and announcing, ‘On the tee, from Scotland, David Jones’. 

I really enjoyed the first hole. You are hitting from a terrace just in front of the clubhouse, down a big drop, onto a huge field below. The fairway isn’t massive side to side but the rough isn’t too punishing. It’s about 280 yards to the dry wash (know as a barranca in these parts) which splits the fairway but I wasn’t expecting to hit a good one, so I hit a driver into the fairway and off we went.

The first at Riviera - probably the easiest hole on the course!

A straightforward par 5 to start is a Thomas trademark and this may be his finest example. Avoiding a topper was the only real thought in my head as we hit off. After that this hole allows you to breathe and enjoy the experience - a lovely start to what would be a memorable round.

A driver from the tee won’t hurt, but it’s all about the angles
I suspect the vast majority of amateur golfers are like me; show us a tee shot with thick trees, water or waist-high rough to the sides of a narrow fairway and we tense up - the swing gets fast and the result is frequently depressing. Well there are no such worries here. From the tee you won’t see huge danger in play. You will almost always be able to hit the ball from wherever it ends up. 

Generally on the course, the rough is of a reasonable depth, most trees allow a punch out and even in the barranca you are likely to have a shot. However, from any of those spots, you will find it hard to get it onto the green with your approach. 

This means that everyone can make progress to the green without too much delay, but only those playing well will have many birdie putts and score well. 

Hitting from hazards is far easier at Riviera than in some LA clubs

Enjoy the special moments….
It is often said that there are no weak holes at Riviera. But there are some standout holes. Some are less well-known than others - I wasn’t familiar with the fifth but it’s sneaky good, with a huge mound built on the right of the fairway blocking your view of the green if you come in from this side. So, you should play up the left to get there in two, but you risk tangling with the trees if you go too far to that side.

The 5th is a less well known, but excellent, hole

Next up is the 6th - a hole to savour. From the middle tees it was just a 7 iron in to this green, but there is a lot to deal with. There are bunkers short, left and behind the green, as well as one bang in the middle! The green slopes significantly from back to front so playing long, past the bunker in the middle, will still leave a challenge for your par. 

The 6th hole at Riviera - note the bunker in the middle of the green

I managed to leave the bunker directly between me and the hole. The scorecard lets you know that amateurs must only take a putter on the green, but I just managed to skirt the edge to hole the putt for a nerve-wracking four. You can see the putt here:

The next hole you are likely to know is the 10th. This is maybe the most famous short par 4 in the world of golf. For years there was a usual choice for pros playing this hole - take a driver and try to get close to the green but risk an offline shot leaving real difficulty getting up and down, or lay back for a fuller shot in. The accuracy and distance of modern equipment mean that virtually all now try to get the ball up to the left of the green, and most succeed.

Looking down the 10th hole from the clubhouse


The challenge for the amateur though is closer to the original intent of the hole. My caddie was very clear, hit a three wood down the left and wedge it in. When you get down there you see what the challenge is. The front of the green is heavily cambered and is just a slither. If the pin is at the front and you are coming in from the right there is virtually no shot a man of my limited skills could hit to keep it on the green. However, from where I was, it was a relatively straightforward wedge up.

The 10th may not pose the same challenge it did to the pros twenty years ago but it is still one of the great examples of a strategic golf hole. Oh yes, and I made a par!

The next few holes have a different feel as you play through the eucalyptus trees. I enjoyed this part of the course which had a lovely serenity about it. 

The 16th hole is a special hole. This short par 3 has a small green, surrounded on all sides by steep, deep bunkers. The sliver trees around the hole add to its beauty and it is just a gorgeous golf hole. All the par threes are pretty special but this may be the best of the lot.

The 16th green is a thing of beauty

The 18th is the final iconic moment in your round. It’s also one of the tougher holes. The tee shot has one of the few forced carries on the course and while it isn’t a long one, it is uphill to a blind fairway - not always a recipe for success. My drive ran off to the right and I was forced to layup in two. In reality though, I would be out there a long time before I hit the green in two. The natural amphitheatre surrounding the green is a fitting climax to your round. As you hole out and look back over the course, you know you’ve just played something pretty special.

If you get a good caddie - enjoy!
I have a checkered past with caddies. It’s not something that I was used to until relatively recently and I’ve only experienced them when playing US private courses. Quite frankly, some of them are useless, just giving me an instruction (‘give me your 160 shot’) followed by a deep sigh when I inevitably screw up. They only take away from my enjoyment of a golf course and usually I would much rather just play on my own. But sometimes it goes well.

My caddie at Riviera was very focussed on me enjoying my round. Before we reached the first green he was already telling me all the celebrities he had caddied for, many in just the last couple of weeks, and the list was impressive. Larry David, President Obama, Justin Timberlake, Tom Brady, Mark Wahlberg - he’d carried for them all. Somehow he managed to impart this information without coming across as an incredible name-dropper (I know, hard to believe!) and it added to my experience of playing Riviera. 

He also had a good knowledge of the club’s history, talked about how the course had changed over the years and tolerated my standard of play with good humour. He didn’t try and play every shot for me, but gave me some advice about the unusual Kikuyu grass and actually explained why he was recommending certain lines or clubs. He added positively to the experience which was a lovely surprise!

Imagine the what if…
There is so much to enjoy at Riviera. It absolutely feels like a golf course well up the top 50 in the world, but there is also a gnawing sense that it could be so much better. I had played Bel Air and LACC on the two days before Riviera. Both have been restored in impressive fashion. LACC is an absolute joy and it feels like you are stepping into a painting from the 1920s. Riviera? Hmm, a bit less so. 

The course has been worked on over the years, but not much has been particularly lauded. A lot of the work in recent years has been done by Fazio and the scars show. Bunkers have lost their original shape, holes have lost their character. The course has been homogenised in too many places when compared to the original Thomas course. When you look at what has been done at LACC you truly wonder what would happen if the club had a management hell-bent on an authentic restoration - it could be magnificent.  

Andy Johnson wrote recently of America’s top candidates for restoration and puts it well when he says, ‘The club could simply restore the original barrancas, bunker styles, and green dimensions without monkeying around with hole lengths or fairway widths. Riviera is currently one of the best golf courses on the West Coast, but it could be one of the best in the country’. The only thing I would add is they could take out the cart paths too…

It would be churlish to end on that note though. Riviera may have flaws in its presentation, but there are none in its design. You don’t have to be an architecture buff to appreciate this course, just teeing it up will be enough. You will find a course which challenges all the way around and you will need every shot in the bag to score well. But it also allows you to breathe, there’s nothing oppressive about Riviera. This is a golf course which will thrill you and give you memories to cherish for life. I’ll tell you one thing, you’ll never forget what you scored at the tenth!

BOOKING THE COURSE

This is yet another one of those American private courses which are hard to play. But the good news is that it isn’t impossible to get a game at Riviera. But be warned - it’s going to cost you.

If you contact the club and explain that you would like to play (I would suggest being suitably reverential in your approach) they may well extend you an offer to play at a quiet time for $575 (late mornings Tuesday-Thursday are best). You obviously need to take a caddie too ($130). Oh yes, and you will need to have an assistant pro accompany you ($200 per group). If you are on your own then that’s a mere $905 for the tee time - it squeezes in under $800 each if you are a 3. Now clearly, on one level this is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a round of golf. But it you really, really want to do it, and you can afford it, you can play here. That’s more than can be said for LACC or Shinnecock, NGLA or Chicago. 

Of course there are other ways too. Keep an eye out for the charity auctions that come up from time to time (although don’t expect to pay less than the prices above) and a fair few clubs have reciprocals with Riviera. These days Riviera is more and more a club for companies and celebrities, so if you happen to know any of those the route in will be much cheaper.

Prices correct as of August 2023.

29,Friar's Head,"Baiting Hollow, NY",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,2003,FRIAR'S HEAD - 19 POINTS,David Jones,rev29_friar_1,"Friar's Head is a relatively new course on Long Island, not far from the bastions of American golf that are Shinnecock Hills and National Golf Links of America. It is the second highest ranked course built in the last 50 years on the GOLF magazine rating, behind only Sand Hills. It was the first Coore and Crenshaw course that I played and has given me a yearning to play more of their designs. 

This course is simply wonderful, this is one of the very best experiences you will ever have on a golf course and surely it will only continue to rise in the rankings. I have been lucky enough to play at Friar's Head twice now and I enjoyed it even more the second time. 

It's not the easiest place to find - the entrance just marked with a black mail box - and it's closed from early November through to the spring. Even when it is open only gets an average of 10 tee times a day. That's pretty quiet. The first time we played it the condition was perfect, the second time after a tough summer a couple of greens were suffering. It is testament to how great the course is that that didn't diminish our enjoyment at all.

Some of the reviews I had read beforehand made me think that the atmosphere may be a little oppressive. I read about strict rules about no photos (apparently relaxed as no-one mentioned it to us) and the importance of hitting your practice shots in such a way as to minimise the divots on the range. This was mentioned in the nicest possible way and it made perfect sense.

The range facility itself was phenomenal - playing brand new prov1s to proper greens before moving to a short game area and a putting green is to die for. The speed of the practice green was spot on with the rest of the course and served as a great way to get your eye in.

Before venturing out onto the course you can play a delightful little nine-holer. No hole was longer than 160 yards but it's a nice way to warm up before taking on the main event. It demanded creativity and certainly sharpened the wedge play nicely.
Friar's Head Coore Crenshaw Golf Course Review
So, to the course itself. There are some articles out there about Friar's Head which do it far better justice than I ever can. This one from Ran Morrissett over at Golf Club Atlas is probably the best and will give you a hole by hole account of the course. There was some discussion on that site as to Friar's Head should be a Doak 9 or 10 when the latest Confidential Guide came out. In the end he gave it a 9, personally I think he was being a bit stingy! 

The course starts with a very playable par 4. I hit driver, but less would do to a wide fairway (actually, I found the sand on the right) and then it's a wedge on 9 iron up to the elevated green (it reminded me of the 1st at the Kings at Gleneagles for those familiar with the opener there).
Friar's Head Scorecard

It is a tremendously hard course to characterise. Holes are carved out of the dunes and the trees and the course transitions seemingly effortlessly between the two. Much is made if you look online at the fact that there are no yardages on the scorecard or tees and there are no yardages to greens on the course. There is a yardage book now available in the pro shop now, but our caddies were fantastic and gave us everything we needed. They gave yardages on the tee, the course measured an almost perfect 6,460 yards. Anything over 6,500 yards and I find that the par 3s can be a little long and the approaches to the par 4s a little testing. This was just right!

There is not a weak hole on the golf course. The 3rd was playing a little shorter to us due to the wind on both occasions but is a 420 yard sweeping uphill hole, often playing the longest par 4 in the course. In contrast the 5th is a delightful short par 4 of only 300 yards. The first time I played I took a driver and then, thinking I was in North Berwick still, took a putter from 50 yards out just to get the wrong slide of a slope and take another 4 to get down. I was in almost the same spot 12 months later and shanked a wedge this time. Ah, the joys! Number 9 plays back through the dunes from the clubhouse to the most fiendish green.  This is pure quality all the way.  

The 10th is a quirky 200 yard par 3 with a truly huge, mostly blind, green. It not be the longest par 3 you'll every play but if your tee shot goes anywhere apart from the right quadrant of the green you are looking at bogey or worse.
The 14th at Friar's Head

14 is a simply magnificent par 5 with steps behind leading up to spectacular 15th tee. Looking back, I should have taken a rescue club off the tee the first time but the caddie did well to find it for me in the wasteland to the right. I managed a par second time around and had some vengeance. The walk from 15 to 16, along the side of the ocean is pretty special and the closing holes continue in the vein of the rest of the course. Breathtaking, fair, and an experience not to be forgotten.

As you can see, I loved this place. The set-up was understated, friendly but incredibly high quality; the caddies were great and the course a dream. Our caddie was telling us that he had caddied earlier in the week for Coore and Crenshaw who are regular visitors - looking at how they can continue to tweak the course. That attention really pays off.

It's definitely the kind of course you just want to go straight back out and play again. It's the best modern course I have played and I would rate it right up there in my top half dozen yet. If you ever get the chance, drop everything and go

BOOKING THE COURSE

Being an American private course a tee time here is tricky. There used to be an annual charity day here but that has moved. Your best bet now is checking out Charitybuzz which regularly has auctions for three balls where you will then join a member to make up a fourball. It’s not a cheap way of playing the course, but unless you know a member it may be the only way!"
30,Friar's Head,"Baiting Hollow, NY",Bill Coore/Ben Crenshaw,2003,Friar's Head,top100golfcourses,rev30_friar_2,"Friar’s Head is located at Riverhead, New York a short distance from Shinnecock Hills. Set in 350 acres, this rugged course was designed by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw and opened for play in 2003 with the philosophy that golf at Friar’s Head should be about options and creativity.

It is a private club where caddies must be used at all times. There are no yardage markers on the course and both members and guests are encouraged to walk the course as opposed to using buggies.

Friar’s Head is routed through rugged, wooded dunes and former farmland. The course starts in the dunes, holes 2 -7 and 11-13 are sited on an old potato farm then the remaining holes are back in the sand hills.

Some of the greens are enormous – they vary in size from 3,000 to 18,000 square feet. Many bunkers are both bearded and huge; others are long strips that are merely huge! To the north of the property, there are 200-foot cliffs overlooking Long Island Sound.

The signature, par four 15th hole is 460 yards long. From an elevated tee position, the tee shot must avoid a cavernous bunker which gathers in shots as the fairway slopes from right to left. The approach shot is then played to a green framed to the rear by trees which partially shield it from winds coming off the Sound.

“What a great place for a golf course!” That innocent remark, made by a golfer on completion of his round at Friar’s Head, captures the tremendous thought and work that went into the course, as the finished course looks like an effortless creation preordained for that piece of land. In truth, however, the course presented a real challenge to its architects, Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw, and the course’s evolution lends insight into their genius.

The property for the Friar’s Head course offered 350 acres on the north shore of Long Island in Baiting Hollow, a hamlet of Riverhead. It included bluffs of three quarters of a mile that rose steeply 150 to 200 feet above the Long Island Sound. There were 165 acres of tree-covered dunes – actually, hills formed by glacial deposits – sandwiched between the crest of the bluffs to the north and farmland to the south.

Although the wooded dunes – housing significant and wild topography with 50 to 75-foot steep elevation changes – stretched unevenly to the south, they uniformly ended abruptly when giving way to the farmland. The unbroken tree line dividing these two starkly contrasting environments served as an immediate warning that this would not be an easy site on which to build a golf course.

Yes, memorable holes could be built among the dunes. However, the dense woods and underbrush made it impossible to discern quickly just how many holes could be properly routed in that section of the property without markedly altering the landscape, which Coore and Crenshaw were philosophically opposed to doing.

The architects strongly believed that this diverse site deserved more than just another Jekyll and Hyde course, so much so that they delayed committing to Friar’s Head for well over a year until they were confident after numerous site visits that they had solved the puzzle and found a routing that would result in something better.

Coore was determined for the holes to flow together as a single course, with seamless transitions between the dunesland and farmland parts of the property. The result of this daunting task is a testament to his painstakingly thoughtful routing of the holes and his firm’s strengths with respect to the details and finishing work.

Eight of the holes are located entirely in the dunes, while four additional holes either start or finish in that section of the property. Each nine starts in the dunes, spills down into the farmland, and then returns to the dunes. The 2nd, 7th, 11th and 14th holes (all three-shotters) ease the transition between the dramatically different parts of the property during play of a hole.

Soon after completing Friar’s Head, Bill Coore was asked what was the best property, other than Sand Hills, on which he and his partner had worked. His studied reply was that, in hindsight, Friar’s Head had proven to be so. Having the natural qualities of a property shine through after tireless work to build the best course possible reflects the highest compliment that can be paid to a design."
31,Winged Foot (West),"Mamaroneck , NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1923,Approaching the Unpinnable,Andy Johnson,rev31_winged_foot_1,"“I wish we played a course like this every week. We’d learn how to putt.” -Jack Nicklaus at the 1974 U.S. Open People often describe the greens at the West Course at Winged Foot Golf Club as treacherous, or scary, or beautiful. I would call them enduring. Designed by A.W. Tillinghast in 1923, the greens at Winged Foot West are the definition of severe. Getting up and down from around them is very difficult, which puts a premium on precise approach shots. Also, the greens have an abundance of unpinnable surface: the false fronts, back wings, and sideboards make short-sided misses a nightmare and reward creative pitches and chips. These features make Winged Foot a great course in spite of its geographical shortcomings (rocky slate soil and relatively bland topography) and have helped it endure the onslaught of advances in equipment technology. Nearly 100 years into its life, Winged Foot West is still one of the world’s great championship tests.

The U.S. Open last visited Winged Foot in 2006, when Geoff Ogilvy won at 5-over. Since then, the players have picked up yet more technological aids. This will be the first time that the world’s best male players will take on the bold, sloping Tillinghast greens with the help of green-reading books that will show them every intricate contour. Winged Foot’s counter will be its restoration, finished by Hanse Golf Course Design in 2015. Gil Hanse enlarged the West Course’s greens by 23.8%, regaining tucked pins not seen since the 1920s and increasing unpinnable surface, which drives the strategy of the course. Winged Foot West’s strategy is best understood from the greens backwards. It’s all about knowing whether or not you are in position to approach certain pins. Of course, for the most part, Winged Foot is a test of execution. The fairways are narrow and lined with thick rough and deep dunkers. But players who walk the course backwards and figure out where they can and can’t attack certain greens will stand the best chance of avoiding those zero-penalty-stroke double bogeys, which the West Course is famous for inflicting. At this week’s U.S. Open, recovery shots will be more about getting back into a position to make par or bogey rather than pulling off a heroic shot for a chance at birdie.

Gil Hanse’s restoration of the greens adds a new dimension. When we last saw the West Course host the U.S. Open in ’06, the greens were shadows of their original selves. They had shrunk, and many of their pronounced corners and fronts had been covered in rough. While often unpinnable, these contours on the edges of the greens produce the theatrics that make Winged Foot truly compelling. The severe grades, often above 10%, punish not only approaches from bad positions but also marginal shots from good positions. Hanse and his team brought back a considerable amount of pinnable surface as well. In the graphic below, provided by Winged Foot Golf Club, you can see that the expansion of the 15th green boosted the average slope by 14% but also increased the amount of pinnable area by 43%.



What does all of this mean? Simply that there are now more options for pins and more contours to bedevil shots from poor angles. Unlike at many PGA Tour stops, where any pin on a grade of more than 1% is frowned upon, there will be many putts at Winged Foot that turn hard at the hole. There will be short-sided pitches that bound forward after landing on the recaptured unpinnable sections. On the flip side, there will also be shots, played from the right positions, that use the same contours to funnel the ball closer to the pin. Basically, these greens will reward players who keep a clear head and pay attention to the ground. There’s an important takeaway for the golf world here. It’s time to embrace undulating greens rather than calling them “unfair” or “Mickey Mouse,” or making the same tired joke about how “all that’s missing is a windmill.” Winged Foot West’s greens are what made the course interesting and challenging in the 1920s, and what will continue to make it interesting and challenging in the 2020s. Yes, they’re playing a lot faster now—probably faster than they should—but their essence has endured. At many modern courses, on the other hand, the greens already seem dated, partly because they don’t have the courage to be wild."
32,Winged Foot (West),"Mamaroneck , NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1923,WINGED FOOT (WEST) - 18 POINTS,David Jones,rev32_winged_foot_2,"I went to Winged Foot by accident. We were due to play a highly ranked course of good repute in Long Island (OK, it was Shinnecock), but they had decided to dump several tons of sand on every green and it was unplayable. So, on that late October morning we found ourselves making a dash to Winged Foot, 30 minutes north of Manhattan and a dream of a course.

Frankly, I was a little worried. The trip was for my Dad’s 70th birthday and I thought it would be too tough for both of us. When I was a kid in the 80s, I remember my Dad having a book about the story of the 1974 US Open that recounted all the horrors that unfolded. I imagined it would be a long slog, with little joy. I’m glad to say I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The first decision we made was a good one - to play off the white tees which were around the magic 6,500 yard mark. It took a little of the sting out of the course and meant that only a couple of holes were totally out of reach in regulation.

For some reason, I had in my mind a course crafted out of a forest, where any shot off line would be hard to find and have no shot back into play. Wrong again. The rough was clingy and thick, but it was still possible to advance it reasonably if you weren’t too greedy. Often recoveries would get just short of the green leaving a good chance of knocking it on. However when we arrived at the green we were faced with some of the most devilish set-ups in the world.

The green complexes are one of the defining characteristics of Winged Foot. Most of them tilt from back to front, so where you leave your approach shot is absolutely key. The first green gives you a wonderful taste of what is to come. It’s a vast, tilting, sloping, bewildering expanse. It is impossible to play it without a sense of wonder and joy!
The 1st green at Winged Foot - a thing of wonder!

Your eyes can deceive you at Winged Foot. There are false fronts galore and the nuances of the slopes mean that playing away from the pin and letting the ball roll in will often be the smart play. It may sound odd, but I found some similarities to a Scottish links course. You can putt the ball from way out, and it may be easier to get the ball to the hole that way rather than trying to get there with a wedge.

The par 5s were all accessible; I was up on 2 of the 4 and I'm not a long hitter. Conversely the 3s are long, with 3 of the 4 being over 190 yards. The standout would be the 10th. With the pin at the back we were playing 195 yards over a valley, but a well hit tee shot was all it took to have a massively sloping 60 footer for birdie (not made!).

Founded in 1906, Winged Foot is a wonderfully historic place to play golf. There are so many great anecdotes, but the 2006 US Open added another bucketful to keep the magic alive. For us Brits, Monty's 7 iron short of the green, pitch and three putt for double lives long in the memory. For what it's worth, I did one better from the same spot on the fairway. It’s another hole defined by the green - a false front will push the ball down to a dell, there are intricate humps and hollows, and you need to be the right side of the flag to have a chance of getting down in 2.

You shouldn’t expect to shoot the lights out at Winged Foot - it’s one of the most revered US Open sites. But you shouldn’t approach it with fear like I did! Suffice to say, off the right tees (I cannot emphasise that point enough) I think that any golfer would have a great time at Winged Foot. I found it a really exhilarating place to play golf. At times your pulse will be racing, but there is also a real calm feeling out in the whispering trees.

I was lucky enough to get back to Winged Foot in September 2019, after the mercurial Gil Hanse had completed a fantastic renovation of the West Course. Bunkers have come out, greens reclaimed and the course is even better for it. As a result of the green expansion work (back to the original sizes) there will be new pin positions possible when the 2020 US Open visits. When I was there they were already well along with getting things ready for the event. The fairways had definitely come in a bit and the rough was a little deeper but I still didn’t feel that it was an unfair challenge. But boy, when they get those greens going for the pros it will be quite scary in places.

This may be the best parkland course I have played. If you get the chance to play it then definitely take up the offer(!), you won't be disappointed. It's a very strong 18 points!
Winged Foot West Scorecard

BOOKING THE COURSE

Well, this is a hard one. It is a high end course which isn't particularly accessible. However, if you are really set on it, then my advice would be to look out for the charity auctions as New Yorkers are a benevolent lot and there are a few opportunities to play there every year. 

TOUR TIPS

If you are playing other courses in the area (Quaker Ridge may be the pick of the lot) then there are tips for staying locally on the Westchester page. Failing that, you are only 30 minutes from Manhattan so you can enjoy the attractions of the Big Apple before heading up. 

Play here is usually only with a member but, if your host has the time I would thoroughly encourage you to try to play the East course too. It is a more accessible course for sure, but fits into the property wonderfully. There are some I know who even prefer it to the West. If you start early enough there should be no problem getting round both the East and the West.

You can’t book a tee time on either course usually - it’s a first-come-first-served roll up on the 1st tee. Caddies are mandatory, and pretty essential when it comes to reading these greens.

This really feels like an old-school members’ club. The locker rooms are reminiscent of those in a 1950s boarding school, there are idiosyncrasies like the burnt toast served before lunch and the ginger biscuits with peanut butter after 9 holes. The clubhouse is adorned with memorabilia from days gone by and you won’t have to wait long to hear stories from the past.

I would also do a shout out to the pro shop. I think it may be the best stocked anywhere in the world. The range is huge and really well sourced. That, combined with the very cool Winged Foot logo, means you will find it hard to leave without getting the credit card out."
33,Pacific Dunes,"Bandon, OR",Tom Doak,2001,Review: Pacific Dunes,Andrew Harvie,rev33_pacific_dunes_1,"“One is a curiosity, two is a destination.” Mike Keiser’s now-famous words represent the expansion of Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, where the destination began with David McLay Kidd’s Bandon Dunes, and became a golf resort with Pacific Dunes.

To this day, Pacific Dunes is considered one of, if not Tom Doak’s best and is consistently debated as the #1 public golf course in North America, alongside Pebble Beach and Pinehurst No. 2.


Opening the golf course, a 370 yard short par 4 greets golfers. Although I have heard some criticism of this hole, like it awkward or not an exciting way to start, I have no issues.


While not the most breathtaking hole here, I love the green complex, which sits into the landscape quite nicely.


The 2nd begins the journey to the Pacific Ocean with a 368 yard two-shot hole. One centreline bunker and one bunker left make it obvious where the preferred angle is, but makes for a more difficult tee shot.


From the right, the golfer plays over the short right bunker with a backstop, which helps. It does not funnel balls as much as it appears to, but will help stop balls from bouncing long. The movement in this green is quite severe; I am a fan.


A better, closer look at the green complex.


The third is the first par 5 at Pacific Dunes, playing one yard shy of 500 due west. A mess of bunkers in the middle provide a distinct left or right angle, with the left side being preferred for those trying to get home in two.


This is a lovely green complex, with some textbook strategy. Tucked into the dune, bunkering on the right corner angles the green from 8-2 on a clock, with a bunker on the left for those who layup. As mentioned, playing left of the bunkers is key to get home in two for longer hitters.


This is just a pleasant green location, which will reveal the Pacific Ocean upon arrival. Less movement than the first two (although still impressive), but a smarter green complex—in my view—as it sits up higher, exposed to the wind, whereas the first two sat down low almost on-grade or below-grade.


The 4th is our introduction to why Pacific Dunes is so highly regarded. Sure, the Pacific Ocean flanks the hole on the right, but behind us is now the 13th, which we play later. Getting a routing to have both nines to play on the major feature of the golf course in a way without long walks puts this golf course up against almost anything else. At 463 yards, this is a monster with the ocean—as mentioned—up the right, and two big bunkers on the left. The more right you can play, the better.


This green is so brilliant. Sitting low into the landscape, the big bunker on the right is blown out, with slopes and contours coming off the left side and bleeding into the green. Why is this important? Bailing out left brings a much more difficult approach to a green that almost slopes away from the golfer now. From the right, you can use the slopes to feed the ball in. A master class in angles, all controlled by the green contours.


After a brief introduction with the ocean, we head inland with the 199 yard par 3, 5th. This is a cool par 3, with a very long green with undulations akin to the ocean waves you just saw on the previous hole.


As mentioned, Pacific’s strength is its routing, bringing you to the Pacific Ocean on three different occurances. However, the separator when debating it against its contemporaries is the strength of the inland holes, which might be better than the oceanside stuff. That begins on the 316 yard par 4, 6th, among the best drive-and-pitch holes on planet earth.


Given the distance of the hole, it should be drivable, but I would love to hear stories of someone keeping it on this green. Set high above the fairway and the two massive bunkers on the left, the hole almost has a verse S shape to it. Hitting it straight to your preferred number will leave a difficult, semi-blind wedge up over the bunkers.


Playing out to the right is better, but you will not get a full wedge.


Cranking driver up near the green could work, but leaves a difficult pitch.


I have played Pacific Dunes twice, one day with 70KM/H winds, and one with no wind, and this is an insanely challenging hole in the wind. Even with no wind, there is trouble everywhere.


The 7th is a very good long par 4 at 464 yards playing back into the forest. The fairway is undulating, but no bunkers or anything, so a nice time to let loose a bit. Missing the fairway too far left or right will result in a lost ball.


This is such a great green complex. I think the picture below speaks for itself.


Another look at the green complex from 2018. This is one of the few approach shots here where I felt like I had to hit it in the air, but a nice change of pace for variety’s sake.

The actual green contours are superb, as well. I was infatuated with this hole on my second spin.


A fairly standard par 4 tee shot at the 8th awaits. At 400 yards on the nose, it is a middle length par 4.


This is another great green complex, with a reverse strategy. Instead of challenging the bunker like that at the 2nd or 3rd, playing to the outside corner actually opens up the green more. The location of the putting surface is A1.


The 9th is a peculiar par 4, but one that I like. 406 yards, we play over a ridge to a blind fairway with two fairways into one.


With a lower green and an upper green, the 9th can be played in two different ways, depending on where the turf department cuts the pin that day. Getting it on the right side of the fairway is preferred, especially to the upper green (which I believe is the more popular of the two).

Left green:


Right green:


The upper green has some impressive movement. I have never played the lower green.


The dual green sets up the start of the back nine with a lower and upper tee, although the upper tee seems to have a better view. At 206 yards, it is a longer par 3 playing back towards the Pacific Ocean with quote the backdrop.


One of the more odd choices of Pacific Dunes, but another thing to seperate itself, is the back-to-back par 3’s to start the back nine, continuing with the 148 yard par 3, 11th. A very demanding short par 3, with a narrow green pinched between bunkering, the ocean, and the hillside.


The tee shot is breathtaking here, and one of the best spots in golf. But the hole isn’t over; the green is amazing as well.

After a superb stretch of golf, it had to come down eventually. Granted, I think having interludes is an important feature of Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly, so having a small interlude here does not hurt. At 529 yards, a par 4 plays around the 4th with a couple bunkers in play.


The layup is fairly chill.


The green complex is another winner, with a massive bunker short left sloping towards the green, fighting the contours coming off the dune that sits to the right. In my view, the green complex really makes the 12th. A perfect reprieve.


A better look, sitting beautifully in between its surroundings.


Why the need for the reprieve? We head to the 444 yard par 4, 13th, a beautifully difficult par 4 alongside the Pacific, with the ocean up the left now.


The green complex sits into the hillside, playing more uphill than you think. At this point, I had hit the first 12 greens in a row, so the caddie for the other people in my group started giving advice because he said he’d never seen anyone hit all 18 greens. He has now, and I am sure it has been done before, but it was one of the better rounds of 2021 for me.


The 14th is the shortest par 3 at Pacific Dunes, maxing out at 145 yards. The caddies in the group joked that Tom Doak never built an island green like his mentor Pete Dye, but the 14th is as close as he got. The green has little margin for error, wrapped with trouble. Additionally, the 14th sits exposed to the wind, high above the 13th and in the dune.


The 15th is a fairly flat and spacious par 5, measuring 539 yards.


An easy way to dunk on Pacific Dunes is targeting the back nine par 5’s with the 12th and 15th because they are less dramatic and more “plain” in presentation, but I disagree. For one, they both head in opposite directions, and given their short nature, one will generally allow the golfer to get after it and push for a birdie. Secondly, the green complexes are still superb, but before the 15th green, we still have to lay up.


What a sick green complex, with a hump short right and the green pushed up. Going for it in two is a viable option on days with the wind coming from the north, but it can be quite difficult to hit.


At 338 yards, I am still not quite sure what to think of the 16th, which continues to play much shorter than the yardage with a summer wind.


You can cut the corner, but it leaves a difficult approach to a green with some intriguing movement. The fairway is as if you crumpled up a piece of paper and tried to smooth is out again. There is no flat lies to be found here, complicating things further.


A different view of the terrain awaiting, which can either be found by cutting the corner on the tee shot of this dogleg right, or the approach shot trying to stop the ball on this somehow-firmer-than the rest.

IMG_2086.JPG
The 17th is a beautiful 208 yard par 3, notably utilizing the redan template. Play it out right and see it funnel down, but it will not get all the way back to the left, likely stopping in the right third.


Finishing off, Pacific Dunes ends on the longest hole on the golf course at 591 yards. A massive blowout bunker that sits on the inside corner of the dogleg left must be avoided at all costs.


The layup is all about not getting ahead of yourself and finishing strong. Fairly straightforward, at this point it is a test of stamina.


A beautiful green site to end the day, well bunkered with a quasi-punchbowl feel.


Run, do not walk, to Pacific Dunes, but I suspect most reading this review already knew that. This is an easy #1 at the resort for me, and among the best golf courses I have ever seen."
34,Pacific Dunes,"Bandon, OR",Tom Doak,2001,Is Pacific Dunes the Best Public Course in America? It Might Well Be.,Sean Ogle,rev34_pacific_dunes_2,"I’ve spent pretty much my entire life living in Oregon. Yet for some reason, I didn’t make it down to Bandon until last November – or 14 years after Bandon Dunes first opened it’s doors.

Every year my golf buddies and I would say, this is the year we’re going to do it, and every year, time, money, or other commitments got in the way.

So when I was out at Portland Golf Club in October, and their membership director told me they needed one more guy for a November trip down to Bandon there really was no way I could turn it down.


And thus began my first trip to what some are calling Golf Mecca.

While I’ve talked to people lucky enough to go down there for a week or more, our trip was a bit abbreviated. Leave on a Monday, back on a Wednesday.  I’ll tell stories and give details of the trip throughout the 4 posts I write about the 4 courses we played, but it started by meeting in Portland at 6am and hightailing it down I5 for 4 hours until we arrived in the seaside town.

Now if you’ve ever been to Oregon, you know that November can be, how shall we say, a little dicey.

For my first trip, I was just hoping for no rain.

When we pulled through the gates and headed out to the practice range, we weren’t met with sun, but it wasn’t raining and it wasn’t that cold – which was perfect in my mind.

There were 16 of us playing Ryder Cup style: the long standing members of the club, and the new members (or non-members), which included myself.

I’d go into the whole handicap fiasco, but if you’re interested in that, see this post.

We hit our balls and after shaking off the nerves we headed over to Pacific Dunes to grab lunch and hit the first tee.

Somehow I ended up with the club champion, and the guy who holds the course record on Pacific  – Tim Hval, the former head pro at the resort.

All I could think was “God, I hope I don’t embarrass myself…”

The Course

Pacific Dunes was the second course built at Bandon and was completed in 2001 and designed by Tom Doak. I’ve always loved Tom’s designs and his minimalist nature.


Pacific is pretty spectacular in the sense that it seems like the course was always there. By looking at it, you wouldn’t have thought an ounce of dirt was moved – the landscape is that fitting for golf.

It’s got a quirky layout going out with one par 3 and coming in with 4 on the back – but that’s part of what makes Pacific Dunes so unique.

It’s highly rated on just about every list there is, including:

#1 Top Courses You Can Play (Golf Magazine)
#20 Top Courses in the World (Golf Magazine)
#3 Top 100 Public in the Country (Golf Digest)
#19 Top 100 in the Country (Golf Digest)
#21 Top 100 in the World (Golf Digest)
I don’t care who you are or what publication you look at, Pacific Dunes isn’t just good, it’s world class.

It’d be my first round at Bandon, and one that had sky high expectations.

Did my experience live up to them? Well, let’s look at the course and I’ll let you know at the end.

Hole by Hole

Distances are from the  6,142 yard green tees, which is where we played.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 304 Yards)

The opening hole at Pacific Dunes isn’t nearly as scary as it looks.

You step up to the tee and in front of you you’ll see rugged undulations, areas of sand and gorse – but no green.

It’s hidden slightly down the right.  That said, there’s more room out there than you think, so keep it left center of the fairway and consider a hybrid or wood – that should get you close enough for an easy wedge on approach.

Pacific Dunes at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort

Hole 2 (Par 4, 335 yards)

#2 is a really well designed short par 4.


You ideally want to be on the left of the fairway for your approach shot, but you have two big bunkers that you’ll have to avoid if you want to be there. Right side is safe, but will two greenside bunkers into play.

Along with reading Dream Golf before you’re next round at Bandon, I’d recommend reading Tom Doak’s Anatomy of a Golf Course. Really helps to put into perspective, why the courses are laid out the way they are – and it gives you a better sense of why they’re ranked as highly as they are.

Pacific Dunes at Bandon Dunes Resort is the #3 Top 100 Public Course in the US

Hole 3 (Par 5, 476 yards)

The first par 5 is a tough hole, even if it’s length doesn’t seem like it.

You have 3 bunkers that are more or less in the middle of the fairway, so you need to actually make shots, rather than just bombing the ball.  Left fairway is a safe bet, or if you can clear the first bunker, directly over it will line you up for the best angle into the green on your approach.


A great example of why having a caddy or yardage book is so essential at Bandon.

Also, whatever you do: don’t go short-right of the green. Took me 3 shots to get out of that bunker.

A little taste of what could be if you don’t place you’re first shot well.

Hole 4 (Par 4, 449 yards)

This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. The hole where “Pacific Dunes” really becomes the course you were expecting. A par 4 over the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean, you obviously can’t miss right. Ever.

I tried, slicing my drive, but there was a convenient little nook right around 250 yards that kept my ball from dropping in (by inches).

This hole has constantly been rated as one of the best par 4s in the world, and once you’re on the tee, it’s not hard to see why.

Welcome to one of the best par 4s you’ll ever play.

Par 5 (Par 3, 181 yards)

The only par 3 on the front, and probably my least favorite of the 5 (you have a lot to look forward to on the back). Also, one of the more difficult greens on the course.

Hole 6 (Par 4, 288 yards)

A fun short par 4 (seems like we’ve already had a few of those, which I really like). You’ll want to be in the center of the fairway edging towards the right for the best angle at a very narrow green. Too far left and not only do you have to contend with the big bunker left of the green, but it makes the green ridiculously shallow, with a big drop off on the right.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 436 yards)

Some people consider this the most difficult course on the entire property. It’s an extremely long par 4 playing 464 from the tips.  If the wind is in your face good luck reaching the green – give the course some respect and layup. That being said, there are some weird bumps and patches of heavy rough that will make finding your ball extremely difficult.

Careful you don’t layup too close to the green
Hole 8 (Par 4, 369 yards)

Another long Par 4 that often plays into the wind (we got lucky and the wind was pretty minimal). Watch out for the false front and make sure you take enough club into your approach.

Hole 9 (Par 4, 379 yards)

This starts one of my favorite strings of hole on any course I’ve ever played. 9-14 of Pacific Dunes are world class no matter how you put it.

9 is somewhat similar to #3 on Old Macdonald as you have a blind tee shot up to a ridge with plenty of room over it.

This hole is also unique in that it actually has two greens an upper and lower – so pay attention to which one is in play.

Hole 10 (Par 3, 163 yards)

You start the back 9 off with one of the most specactular par 3s on the paroperty. An elevated tee plays down to a green that sits right on top of the Pacific, giving you unparalled 360 degree views.


Watch out for unplayable lies in the thick brush to the left of the green, slightly right is the safer play.

Hole 11 (Par 3, 131 yards)

Just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, Hole 11 is another par 3 and has the smallest green. Playing parallel with the Ocean, I promise this a hole (and a view) you won’t soon forget.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 12 (Par 5, 507 yards)

After back to back par 3s we have a reachable par 5. The biggest danger here is going to be your approach, especially if you’re trying to get home in two. There’s a big bunker guarding the front of the green, and a large mound right behind the green that doesn’t give you a whole lot of room to work with – so keep a close eye on your yardages.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 13 (Par 4, 390 yards)

13 gives #4 a run for it’s money as the best par 4 on the course. Playing the opposite way as #4 (meaning into the wind) two accurate shots are necessary.  This is a deep and narrow green, so consult your caddie as to where the hole location is for the day.

Also don’t forget to take a second on the tee and soak in your surroundings, golf simply doesn’t get a whole lot better than this.

Hole 14 (Par 3, 128 yards)

While not right on the ocean, 14 is still a really cool par 3. Take note of the wind, as this hole can play much shorter than it’s yardage states.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 15 (Par 5, 504 yards)

This hole sucked…well for me at least ha. My tee shot barely cleared the gorse on the left and popped over to the next fairway. Because of my struggles aiming I didn’t get a photo of this one, so we’ll just move onto 16 🙂

Hole 16 (Par 4, 338 yards)

A couple years back Golf Digest called the 16th at Pacific one of the “18 Most Fun Courses Golf Courses in America.” 

While it’s certainly no stretch to say that, I’m not sure it’s quite as much fun as some of the other holes at Bandon.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon



Hole 17 (Par 3, 189 yards)

The 4th and final par 3 on the back 9.

Playing about 180 from our tees I thought my 5 iron would be plenty of club – not so much. You don’t want to go short as you have a difficult and potentially steep up and down, but if you’re too long, you’re in the gorse. Don’t try and be a hero, just get it on the green.

Pacific Dunes is a Top 100 Golf Course in Bandon, Oregon

Hole 18 (Par 5, 575 yards)

While I’ve heard many people say that Pacific lacks a good opening and closing hole, I don’t necessarily agree.



I think this par 5 is a really visually interesting hole, that can be difficult the first time you play it (or every other time for that matter). Careful on your approach as there are some pretty terrifying bunkers surrounding the green.

Closing Thoughts

As a whole being at Bandon was even better than I thought it would be (is that possible?). The courses had much more variety than I was expecting, the camaraderie and vibe around the entire complex was unlike anything I’d experienced, and we had unbelievable weather for the trip.

However, there was only one thing that I’d say slightly disappointed me. What was it?

Pacific Dunes.

Don’t get me wrong, the course was phenomenal. The ocean views, unparalleled.  But, there were a couple reasons I wasn’t as wowed quite as much as I was expecting.



The first? While we were there the greens were in pretty rough shape. They were slow and pretty grown out – something I wasn’t expecting. Obviously playing on fescue is very different than most golf in North America, but the greens were in by far the worst shape of any of the other courses.

The other reason I was slightly let down, is partially because the other courses were all so good – namely Bandon Trails.

The inland course which is always rated the lowest on major polls of the Bandon Courses was actually my favorite.

I thought it had the most fun and unique holes, was in great shape, and wasn’t at all hindered by the forest landscape.

I was expecting Pacific to be far and away a better course than Trails, and it wasn’t, or at least I didn’t think so.

So while I loved all of the courses there, I think the reason I found myself slightly disappointed was because comparatively everything else was still so good. Talk about a high quality problem.

That being said, have you been to Bandon Dunes? I’d love your feedback on whether or not Pacific was your favorite?

In the meantime, I think I need another round to give a proper rating. Guess I should go back next month 🙂

Yep, that’s happening."
35,Prairie Dunes,"Hutchinson, KS","Perry Maxwell, 1937/Press Maxwell, 1957",1937,Perry’s Nine,Andy Johnson,rev35_prairie_dunes_1,"It was 100 degrees outside. Since we had already walked 36 holes in the past 22 hours, we agreed that a change of pace was in order. We decided to try some time travel. We were at Prairie Dunes Country Club in Hutchinson, Kansas. Both that morning and the previous evening, we had played 18-hole rounds. All the while, in the distance, there was a low, continual din of shouting and splashing. The heat had driven a crowd of local kids to the club pool. At times, sweating in my hat and collared shirt, I almost envied them. Almost, I say, because the golf was so good. Perry Maxwell, the great Oklahoma-based architect, built the first nine holes at Prairie Dunes in 1937. Twenty years later, his son Press completed the course, but he didn’t simply build the new nine on a separate piece of land. Rather, he added three holes to the west side of the clubhouse and six to the east. In doing so, he followed his father’s plans, though there is some doubt as to how faithful he was. Today, the old version of Prairie Dunes—consisting of Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, and 18—sits embedded within the modern one. A few of these holes are not only the best on the course but among the finest anywhere. Our time-traveling notion on that hot afternoon was simple: to play Perry Maxwell’s original nine.
Minimalism—by necessity and preference

The less of man’s handiwork the better a course. – Perry Maxwell Like Southern Hills, Perry Maxwell’s tour de force of championship golf in Tulsa, Prairie Dunes was a product of the Great Depression. Maxwell drew up 18 holes, but he ended up building only nine. The construction itself, headed by his brother-in-law Dean Woods, was a model of thrift. They hired men through the Works Progress Administration, used rudimentary equipment, and moved a bare minimum of earth. This approach happened to suit Maxwell just fine, as he believed in low-cost minimalism with a kind of evangelistic zeal. Speaking to The American Golfer in 1935, he said, “It is my theory that nature must precede the architect, in the laying out of links. It is futile to attempt the transformation of wholly inadequate acres into an adequate course. Invariably the result is the inauguration of an earthquake. The site of a golf course should be there, not brought there. Many an acre of magnificent land has been utterly destroyed by the steam shovel, throwing up its billows on earth, biting out traps and bunkers, transposing landmarks that are contemporaries of Genesis.” These convictions of Maxwell’s were as much financial as they were aesthetic. His trips to Great Britain persuaded him that American golf was mired in unsustainable addictions. As he put it his American Golfer interview, “[T]he majority of American golf clubs are in the red, gore of the steam shovel, blood drawn by the mound-builders. We have learned nothing from Scotland or England where the ancient and honorable game can be enjoyed on marvelous links at one tenth the admission fees, dues, green fees, etc., that prevail in the land of the free.” Maxwell’s spartan methods were well suited to tough times, and in the 1930s, when many other golf architects stopped working, he continued to design and build courses. In 1935, Maxwell met with the Carey family about building a course on the outskirts of Hutchinson, Kansas. Depending on which historical account you believe, either Maxwell spotted or the Careys showed him a stunning tract of Ice Age-forged dunesland east of town. Beneath the wild grasses, yucca, sandhill plum, and cottonwood trees, he must have recognized the undulations, large and small, that would make for compelling golf.
Since Maxwell preferred not to design from maps, he spent a month simply walking the property. “You see,” his son Press said, “he had so much ground to work with that he wanted to see it all, and from all directions. He didn’t design courses from maps. He went out in the field because he wanted to be right in the place where the game was to be played.” It was around this time that Maxwell delivered his most reprinted line: “There are 118 holes here, and all I have to do is eliminate 100.” The construction methods were rustic. Under the supervision of Dean Woods, whom Press referred to as “an old fellow who was opposed to the use of tractors,” the WPA crew built Prairie Dunes quickly and cheaply in the first half of 1937. As Mal Elliott writes in his book Perry Maxwell’s Prairie Dunes, “The construction of the course was done with teams of horses and mules, 18 in all, and slips and Fresno scrapers and wheelbarrows. There was not one piece of mechanized equipment except for the Model T and Model A Fords and trucks which took the workers to the site. The greens and fairways were cleared and scraped by teams dragging plows and scoops. The roots of native grass and weeds were all removed by hand, one wheelbarrowful at a time.”

Using simple methods at the Prairie Dunes construction site

The result was a course that, to this day, meshes humbly yet artfully with the landscape. The transitions between the manmade and the natural—the “tie-ins,” as modern architects call them—are nearly imperceptible. When Perry’s nine opened in September 1937, knowledgeable golfers, including Walker Cupper Johnny Dawson, saw it for what it was: the best nine-hole course in America. (For the historical narrative above, I relied on three books: Mal Elliott’s Perry Maxwell’s Prairie Dunes; Christopher Clouser’s The Midwest Associate; and Anthony Pioppi’s To the Nines. All are excellent reads.)
Perry’s nine

When we set out to rediscover Perry’s nine that afternoon in late June, we knew we weren’t the first. Anthony Pioppi, for one, had played the original course in preparation for his book To the Nines. Also, the members of Prairie Dunes Country Club are well aware of the distinction between the “Perry holes” and the “Press holes,” and I’m sure many of them have taken a crack at the old nine. Nor did we intend our experiment as a slight to Press Maxwell’s work. While the Perry holes are generally better (“Press did not have the imagination and vision his father had,” Jake Carey told Pioppi), the Press holes would be standouts anywhere else. A few of them, especially the slanting, tempting par-4 14th, are among my favorites on the course. Still, as we discovered, there is a special rhythm and coherence to Perry’s nine that you can appreciate only by playing it in its 1937 sequence.
Hole No. 1
1937: par 4, 415 yards
Today: par 4, 452 yards
The tough opening hole swings to the left, into the prevailing wind, daring you to cut the corner to get a shorter approach. The real fun starts at the green. From the 1930s to the present day, golf writers have spoken of “Maxwell’s rolls,” and this green is a good example of why. Here, instead of simple tiers, you see ripples that rise to a point and fall away. This style of contouring raises the stakes of the shots played into, around, and on the green: if your ball finds the correct side of a “roll,” it will collect toward the pin; if it doesn’t, it will swerve away.

Hole No. 2
1937: par 3, 140 yards
Today: par 3, 164 yards
Benched into the property’s main ridge of dunes, the 2nd is an imposing target, even if it sits only 140 (or from today’s back tees, 164) yards away. The green points to about 10 o’clock, asking for a left-to-right shot shape. The wind, however, tends to push the ball to the right, toward a back bunker where, I can assure you, you do not want to be.

After finishing on the 2nd green, we made our first deviation from the modern routing of the course. Instead of hiking up to today’s 3rd tee, we took a path to the left, through the “gunsch.” It was a stirring walk.

Hole No. 6 (formerly No. 3)
1937: par 4, 335 yards
Today: par 4, 387 yards
Right away, we saw that the forward tee of the 6th hole must have been the main tee of the original 3rd. From there, the hole unfurls around a big bunker on the left. Beyond this intimidating hazard, there is an area of maintained rough from which a sightline opens to the left portion of the crowned green. A fairway bunker on the right guards the other decent look at various pins. From the middle of the fairway, your view is obstructed by a flashed bunker that appears to abut the putting surface but is in fact 13 yards short.

The current 6th is one of several holes at Prairie Dunes that would benefit from fairway expansion. Pushing the mowing lines to the outer edges of both fairway bunkers would bring the best, riskiest options back into play.

Advantageous angles from the rough on the 6th hole at Prairie Dunes. Note also the modern back tee (bottom right) and the path to the forward tee from the 2nd green. (Google Earth)

On other holes, especially today’s Nos. 9, 17, and 18, rough has encroached on safe but less strategically desirable sides of the playing corridors. In those places, the longer grass is unnecessary;  the poor angles should be the main penalty. Unlikely as it seems, then, Prairie Dunes, one of the greatest courses anywhere, could be even better. From the 6th green, we walked straight back to another original tee that now serves as a forward tee. It’s a peaceful spot. A pair of cottonwood trees provide shade, encouraging a moment of reflection.

The 6th (formerly 3rd) hole from what used to be the 4th tee

Hole No. 7 (formerly No. 4)
1937: par 4, 440 yards
Today: par 5, 512 yards
The 7th hole is now a short par 5, but Maxwell designed it as a long par 4. Once you find the fairway, you can either lay up to a generous area short of the green-side bunkers or trust your downwind approach to hold a green surrounded by treacheries of undulation, sand, and shrubbery.

Hole No. 8 (formerly No. 5)
1937: par 4, 395 yards
Today: par 4, 468 yards
The best known hole at Prairie Dunes tumbles over some of the most impressive terrain on the property—huge, lurching waves of land. The usual left-to-right wind diverts tee shots toward a stretch of gunsch where, if you find your ball, you will have no view of the green and no real hope of hitting it. Only with a powerful drive will you avoid a blind second shot. Even then, you will likely be hitting from an awkward lie to a severely canted green perched high in the sand hills. This is golf as pure adventure.

Hole No. 9 (formerly No. 6)
1937: par 4, 400 yards
Today: par 4, 452 yards
If the 8th hole shows off the Hutchinson dunesland at its most dramatic, the 9th emphasizes its subtler contours. A closely mown swale to the left of the green influences tactics all the way back to the tee. To be able to aim your approach away from this hollow instead of toward it, your tee shot has to ride the wind to the left side of the fairway without sailing into a large, gnarly bunker. The more you hedge away from this hazard, the worse the angle of your second shot becomes. Complicating matters, toward the safe, right side of the fairway, the undulations grow bigger, increasing the likelihood of a lie that will conspire with the wind to force your approach left, toward that green-side basin.

Hole No. 10 (formerly No. 7)
1937: par 3, 160 yards
Today: par 3, 185 yards
Like the 7th hole, the 10th runs with the prevailing wind. And as on the 7th, Maxwell tests your ability to hold the green by placing bunkers short. When the pin is on the right, you have two options: 1) drop a downwind mid-iron just past the bunker on the right and somehow keep it from running through, or 2) go left and accept the inevitability of a triple-breaking, 60-foot lag putt. When I think of a prototypical scalloped Maxwell green, this one comes to mind. From the devilish hummock center-right, to the merciful central channel, to the repelling edges front left and back left, every section makes for delightful chipping and putting.

Hole No. 17 (formerly No. 8)
1937: par 5, 510 yards
Today: par 5, 523 yards
Here is where our time travel briefly failed: Maxwell’s original tee was just behind the 10th green, and the tee shot played diagonally across the dune ridge between Nos. 17 and 18. There was visible room to the left, but position A was to the right of the hog’s back in the fairway, blind from the tee and close to death in the prairie grass. From there, you had a chance to go for the narrow, elevated green, guarded by bunkers left and a drop-off right. We were unable to hit from the original teeing ground, however. In expanding the course to 18 holes, Press moved the 17th tee to the east. Now it is a straightaway hole—still excellent, but not as fun.

Hole No. 18 (formerly No. 9)
1937: par 4, 370 yards
Today: par 4, 390 yards
While relatively short, this finishing hole, Perry’s 9th, is a culminating trial of nerve. As on the No. 17, the garden spot is on the right, but a strong right-to-left slope makes it hard to hit. Also, since this section of the fairway is concealed form the tee, and since the wind presses scarily toward the dunes on the right, a bailout to the left just feels better. It results, however, in a blind approach that would have been even more uncomfortable when the bunker pit short of the green had sand in it. As a finishing hole for match play, No. 18 at Prairie Dunes is ideal. It can yield birdies as readily as X’s.

The course of time

We finished Perry’s nine as evening advanced, and in spite of the heat, we felt invigorated. In our morning round that day, we had taken in the full breadth of 21st-century Prairie Dunes by playing all 18 holes from the tips. Even at a “mere” 6,900 yards, it felt (at least to me) like a championship brute. The green-to-tee walks were long, backwards, and frequently uphill. From the elevated back tees, I found my field of vision dominated by gunsch rather than short grass. It was a great, stern examination of golfing ability. We anticipated that Perry’s nine would be a different experience, but we didn’t know how different. Rather than a test, it felt like a charming adventure. As we followed the old transitions from hole to hole, the routing fit together like a puzzle. It returned to the clubhouse three different times, offering moments of respite before lighting out again for the dunes. The original landing zones came into focus, inspiring one of us to pull the head cover off his persimmon driver. Our imaginations wandered continually back to 1937: in the middle of a vast continent, an ideal course on ideal land, with wind—sometimes mild, sometimes fierce—generating variety day to day… Golf courses wear their histories, some better than others. At Prairie Dunes, time has been generous. The modern 18-hole course is wonderful, but within it sits my favorite nine-hole course in America, lovely and exacting and resilient, still available to the adventurous."

The course, or at least 9 holes, opened for play in 1937 and Perry Maxwell laid them out. Maxwell believed absolutely that “the golf course should be there, not brought there,” and he surveyed the 480-acre site day after day for weeks before making any decision on the routing. Perry’s son, James Press Maxwell extended the course to 18 holes in 1956.

Naturally, the end result is a course that is natural, and although there’s no salty taste of the sea on your lips, there’s everything else that is essential to make a perfect day’s golf. First of all there is sand and sand to spare, secondly there is the ever present Kansas wind – the energy from which is being harnessed liberally across the state – thirdly the land pitches and rolls in a delightful seaside style and fourthly the holes are designed in a thoughtful, cunning and strategic fashion. The sum of this is pure golfing heaven.

Writing in Tom Doak's Little Red Book of Golf Course Architecture, the author commented as follows: ""What makes Prairie Dunes special is the severity of the greens and the wonderful choice of green sites. Interestingly there are a lot of uphill approach shots, which a lot of people don't love and some don't like about my own work, but those green sites are what makes the course challenging. It's also a special place in terms of atmosphere... it takes some effort to get there, but they are always so hospitable to people who have made the trip to see them, and they are really humble about what a good course it is because they aren't there to impress anybody, they are there to enjoy it themselves.""

Prairie Dunes is a private club and casual green fees are not accepted. If you want to experience this stunning inland links course (renovated by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw in 2004) and you are willing to make the long journey to Hutchinson Kansas, we suggest you ask your home club to prepare a letter of introduction. Who knows you might find yourself teeing it up at the 1st “Carey Lane”."
37,Oakland Hills (South),"Bloomfield Hills, MI",Donald Ross,1917,Oakland Hills (South),top100golfcourses,rev37_oakland_hills_1,"Oakland Hills Country Club played host to the 2004 Ryder Cup matches between the USA and Europe. Team Captains were Hal Sutton (US) and Bernhard Langer (Europe). The 35th Ryder Cup was the most one-sided contest for a number of years. Europe led America by 11-5 going into Sunday’s singles and when Sergio Gargia rallied to beat reigning Masters Champion Phil Mickelson 3 and 2, the writing was on the wall for the home team. Colin Montgomerie secured the winning point against David Toms but the entire European team played their part in achieving a record-breaking victory, which included rookies Thomas Levet and Ian Poulter scoring their first points. Europe 18 ½ - USA 9 ½. The Ryder Cup was played at The Belfry in 2002 and at The K Club in 2006.

Oakland Hills Country Club is located on Michigan’s rolling Bloomfield Hills. The club has two courses, the famous South course and the less famous North course.

Donald Ross laid out the South course in 1917 and Robert Trent Jones toughened the layout up ahead of the 1951 US Open, which was won emphatically by Ben Hogan. After his win, Hogan commented that he had “brought this monster to its knees” and since then the course is affectionately known as “The Monster”.

”The most pungent remark made during the controversial 1951 Open Championship at Oakland Hills Country Club,” wrote Robert Trent Jones in The Complete Golfer, “came from that patriarch of professional golf, Walter Hagen: ‘The course is playing the players instead of the players playing the course.’ In this comment, Hagen summed up the psychological shock suffered by the world’s ranking golfers when they encountered the remodelled course, for these modern players had been getting away with murder for years, and didn’t know it. They had been playing over course that, with a few exceptions, had been laid out in the 1920s, or earlier, and which had been tailored for the equipment and the ball and the playing conditions of that era.”

Rees Jones – son of Robert Trent Jones – undertook a series of renovations (mainly bunkering) to the South course ahead of the 2008 PGA Championships and the layout was stretched out in excess of 7,300 yards. Oakland Hills once again became a fearsome test with only three players beating par. Padraig Harrington followed in the footsteps of Gary Player and David Graham who were former Oakland Hills PGA winners (1974 and 1979 respectively). Harrington’s two closing rounds of 66 were enough to give him a two shot victory over Sergio Garcia. But Harrington was perhaps even more pleased to become the first European to win consecutive majors as he followed up his 2008 Open Championship win at Royal Birkdale by triumphing in the 2008 USPGA at Oakland Hills.

Gil Hanse has been advising Oakland Hills Country Club on course restoration since 2015. There may now be fewer trees, but with six US Opens and one Ryder Cup under its belt, the South should still be treated with respect. We think that you’ll certainly appreciate the challenge and therefore we recommend that you befriend a member immediately. We also think that Oakland Hills is one of the fairest tests of golf in the land. Do you agree?"
38,Oakland Hills (South),"Bloomfield Hills, MI",Donald Ross,1917,Oakland Hills (South Course): About as Storied as It Gets,Sean Ogle,rev38_oakland_hills_2,"I wasn’t sure if Oakland Hills was going to happen – but man did I want it to.

One of the most frequently asked questions on the trip was “How did you get on the private courses?”

Medinah was pretty straight forward, Oakland Hills, not so much.

The common answer: “It was a friend of a friends, dad’s business partner’s, business partner” – and that pretty much sums it up.

I’m learning that a big part of the fun of going for the Top 100 is all of the cool people you meet along the way and the interesting circumstances that will have to present themselves in order to get on the courses.

After playing Medinah the week prior, I was kind of expecting Oakland Hills to look a lot like that.  Long winding entrance way with very grandiose feeling, looking grounds.

The reality wasn’t actually quite like that.

When you pull up to Oakland Hills there’s a small sign that says “members only” and then a very short driveway up to the bag drop in front of the back of the club.  The attendant took our clubs and we parked the car and made our way to the mens locker room.

Here you don’t use cell phones, and you don’t put your shoes on in the parking lot – you’re given a locker close to the member who is accompanying you and you do it in there.

The clubhouse at Oakland Hills is hands down the most beautiful I’ve ever been in.  From the locker room to the mens bar to the mixed dining room, it was all first rate.

Our member hadn’t arrived yet, so we made our way to the range which was very nice, but surprisingly short. My first reaction was “I bet the pros could hit it 150 yards past the treeline.” I later found out that during tournaments like the Ryder Cup and PGA Championship that they use part of the North Course for a driving range – along with Parking.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US
Well manicured, but not exactly long…

Denton showed up about 10 minutes later and we got to know each other a bit before heading to the putting green.

This is when I got scared.  The hole I’d picked to putt on was right at the crest of a hill. I knocked it up there to within an inch, and then watched it roll back down about 15 feet…3 times.  I finally learned I could hit it above the hole and it would roll back down in – that was fun, I just prayed that the entire course wouldn’t be so evil.

I was pretty excited to hit the course as this is my first Donald Ross design  and is one of the most storied golf courses in the world, having hosted:

6 US Opens (1924, 1937, 1951, 1961, 1985, 1996)
3 PGA Championships (1972, 1979, 2008)
US Senior Open (1981, 1991)
US Amateur (2002)
Ryder Cup (2004)
If that isn’t an unbelievable collection of tournaments – I don’t know what is.

For everyone’s sanity we decided to play the white tees, which still measured 6,512 yards.

And with that we stepped up the to the first tee on the 20th best course in the US.

Front Nine at Oakland Hills South Course:

Let’s do this thing.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 382 yards)

What you immediately notice about the first hole at Oakland Hills is just how narrow the fairways are.  Bunkers within reach surround both sides and just beyond that are trees.

We all sprayed our drives a bit, and mine was what appeared to be the least damaging lying just off the fairway in the rough.  This was until we walked down and checked out the rough.  Thick.  Immaculately maintained, but thick.

After having what was probably the best warm up I’d ever had, it was as though I’d forgotten how to play golf on this first hole.  May have been because the gravity of the course I was playing had finally sunk in.

A triple bogey is not how you want to start off when playing one of those “once in a lifetime” rounds.

Hole 2 (Par 5, 485 yards)

A shorter par 5 dogleg left, but not one I was even remotely thinking of going for in 2 as my goal now was just to keep the ball in play and try and make some pars.

The tee shot is slightly blind with heavy bunkering along the left and at the dogleg on the right.  Best shot is to keep it left center of the fairway, and then play smart shots all the way into the bunkered and elevated green.

Hole 3 (Par 3, 164 yards)

The first par 3 on the course was also the site of one of my best shots of the trip.

I pulled out a 6 iron and picked an aggressive line directly over the front bunker.  I cleared it by about 2 feet and the ball must have rolled within an inch of pin, stopping about 2 feet away.  Putt in for birdie.

This is one of those times where you can’t help but think “I bet at some point during a tournament Jack didn’t make birdie on this hole…”  Nevermind the fact the pros were probably an extra 50 yards back.

Hole 4 (Par 4, 410 yards)

Another dogleg left with a narrow fairway. Slightly downhill approach with heavy bunkering.

Hole 5 (Par 4, 394 yards)

This was the point where I was starting to get concerned about all the dogleg lefts, which definitely do not play well to my fade.  My driver was off all day, and this was one of the worst examples of it, slicing it hard and almost getting it to the 6th fairway.  A creek runs through at about 280 out which on this day wasn’t reachable for any of us.

There was a lot of extra room around the fairway and green here, I can only imagine the masses on a tournament day.

Hole 6 (Par 4, 343 yards)

One of my favorite holes on the front 9.  Similar to 11 on the back, this is a short par 4 with bunkers everywhere, and you guessed it, yet again another narrow fairway.  3 wood or iron is the play here, as you don’t want to be in any of the bunkers on this course.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 358 yards)

If you’re not driving the ball well, this is a scary hole. Water all along the right and bunkers all down the left.  I played 3 wood and landed it middle of the fairway about 140 out.  It felt longer from the tee than it actually played.

Hole 8 (Par 5, 462 yards)

Short par 5, but don’t mistake that as easy.  Straight away with very narrow fairway, bunkers everywhere and a pretty severely elevated green. Play 3 smart shots here, and this could be a good birdie opportunity.  Long is better than short on the approach as those bunkers are exactly where you don’t want to be.



During tournaments the course plays at a par of 70, this hole along with 18 are turned into par 4s.

Hole 9 (Par 3, 196 yards)

My second attempt at a hole in one on the course.  The bartender at the bar we were at the night before said “Remember, on 9 it may look shorter, but you’ll need all of the distance on this one and probably an extra club more.”

Playing 205 out, I heeded his advice and opted for my 3 hybrid.  I wish I had a photo of where the ball landed – 3 inches to the left of the pin.  It stopped about 4 feet from the pin and in all of my nervous glory I missed the putt and settled for par.

Back Nine on the South Course at Oakland Hills:

The back 9 is well, just as tough as the front…

Hole 10 (Par 4, 418 yards)

They don’t make things any easier once you swing around to the back. I learned this the hard way. I was flying high after shooting a 43 on the front and playing some of the best golf of the trip.

The back 9 would be a different story entirely.

A long par 4 with a fairway that sloped in just about every direction imaginable.

Also notice that one tree on the left, if you ever see it, tell it I want my ball back. There aren’t many places at Oakland Hills to hit it in the trees – but apparently I was determined to find every single one of them.

Hole 11 (Par 4, 384 yards)

Possibly my favorite hole on the course. Short par 4 with an S-Curve fairway and elevated green. Pop it over the left bunker to get some roll down to the base of the fairway and have a relatively short approach.

Hole 12 (Par 5, 526 yards)

Fun par 5 that requires a smart 2nd shot. Bunkers on the left and trees on the right with a sharp dogleg.  You probably won’t reach the dog leg off your drive, but aim to the left side of the fairway to give yourself the best angle at getting close after 2.

Depending on where you are you can cut the corner over the trees to get it closer to the green, but unless the pin placement is left, it probably won’t do you a whole lot of good. Elevated green with lots of fun bunkering.

Oakland Hills Country Club South Course

Hole 13 (Par 3, 152 yards)

Hit the green or else.  That’s pretty much all there is to say about this par 3. If you aren’t on the green, you probably won’t be liking where you do find yourself.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 14 (Par 4, 448 yards)

The #2 handicap hole and the only one that I would say is just plain unfair.  Measuring 456 yards (or just 20 yards shorter than a couple of the par 5s on the course) this hole is long and difficult.


By the time I did finally reach the green, I had one of the more fun putts of the day that was a double breaker downhill from the front of the green.  Luckily it was one of the better putts of the day and allowed me to save my triple.

A note about the greens – personally I didn’t find them to be as difficult as I was expecting.  I thought the greens on the River Course at Blackwolf and even on our prior days round at Forest Dunes were a little bit tougher.

Looking back though I think that was a bit of a facade.  I just was finally putting halfway decent at Oakland Hills. Dan had at least one 4 putt and a bevy of 3 putts, and he said of all the courses he played in Michigan, that OHCC by far had the most diabolical greens.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 15 (Par 4, 370 yards)

While still a dogleg left, this is another fun one.  With three giant bunkers right in the middle of the green you have to be smart off the tee. Best placement is left of the bunkers without being in the trees.

This gives you a manageable approach shot to the uphill green.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US
No big deal, just a trio of bunkers right in your landing area 🙂

Hole 16 (Par 4, 377 yards)

The signature hole on the course, and a daunting one from the tee. You need to get your ball far enough out to have a good play at the green, but even a moderate slice will leave you wet.

The approach isn’t any easier as the water wraps farther around the back than you think, and well, there are bunkers everywhere else.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 17 (Par 3, 176 yards)

The last par 3 and arguably the most difficult.  Playing 185 and very uphill, it’s another case of “if you aren’t on the green, you probably won’t be happy.”


 


In my case I was the only one to land on the green, and I still wasn’t very happy as I found this to be one of the most difficult greens on the course.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US

Hole 18 (Par 5, 467 yards)

We end with a solid chance at birdie on this short par 5. Downhill off the tee and then back up on the approach, the 18th green nestled at the base of the clubhouse is quite a sight and a somewhat sad one at that, as it meant our round, and effectively the trip had come to a close.

Oakland Hills Country Club is one of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the US
One of those rounds you simply don’t want to end..
The member who took us out, Denton, told me on the 14th that we had to stay for lunch to try their home brewed IPA.  Being from the Northwest and a bit of a beer snob, there’s no way I could say no to that.  What I wasn’t expecting was the choice between their typical IPA and one aged in Woodford Reserve bourbon barrels – this became a no brainer.

Bourbon aged beers are some of my favorite, and this was easily one of the best I’d had. A totally unexpected surprise to see at a historical golf club near Detroit. I would have had 3 of them had I not had to immediately drive 5 and a half hours to Milwaukee to catch my flight to San Francisco.

Overall I actually enjoyed my round at Oakland Hills even more than I expected to. Although we played the front 9 at a fairly breakneck pace, and it wasn’t the most beautiful of weather days, the course was a lot of fun.  It rewarded you for hitting good shots, and when you did hit those good shots, it truly felt like an accomplishment.

It’s not hard to see why this course has so much history, and I just hope that one day I’ll be able to make it back and try and bring the “Monster” to it’s knees once again."

Set delightfully on a headland wedged between Lake Michigan and Crystal Lake in America’s Midwest, a rudimentary 9-hole layout was first brought into play in 1927, but this course was transformed and extended to 18 holes by Alister MacKenzie and Perry Maxwell over succeeding years.

Maxwell supervised course construction, returning each summer to live in a farmhouse beside what is now the 8th fairway, until the back nine was finally completed in 1933.

“MacKenzie, who was making his way back across America with the intention of returning home to Scotland, along with his then associate Maxwell, was talked into a trip to the wilds of Northern Michigan.” Wrote Mike Stachura in American Classic Courses. “What they saw once they got to this pristine golfing land set on a 100-foot-high sand-ridge overlooking both Crystal Lake and Lake Michigan was an opportunity to work a magical piece of property.

MacKenzie would draw up the holes in the late 1920s, not long after finishing his work at Cypress Point and his touch-up work at Pebble Beach, and only a few years before his collaboration with Bobby Jones at Augusta National. Clearly at the height of his game, he created at Crystal Downs a series of unconventional but spectacular holes (the kidney-shaped green on the seventh hole is unforgettable), all of them legitimate challenges for even players of the highest ability both then and now. The combination of the setting, the ever-present wind off Lake Michigan, the staggered, undulating, angled fairways and the adventurous greens make Crystal Downs a unique challenge.”

Writing in The Confidential Guide to Golf Courses, Tom Doak explains that until the mid-1980s, Crystal Downs was genuinely Michigan’s hidden gem:

“Most people who known me have heard of Crystal Downs, the Alister MacKenzie course that lured me to northern Michigan as a college student in 1982, so it’s hard to explain how unknown the course was back then. The only person on the GOLF Magazine rating panel to have played the course was Jack Nicklaus, who visited on a summer trip with his parents as a young teen; even in Detroit, the most that you could find anyone to say about it was that they’d heard it was very good. I decided to investigate and fell in love with the course and the region.”

Fittingly, Renaissance Golf Design was involved with restoration of the 13th green and 14th tee before expanding the 2nd green in 2017. Hole locations in the middle and back tiers of of the 11th green were then scheduled for extension the following year.

Tom Doak commented as follows in his January 2020 newsletter:

“I only got over to play the course where I pay to belong for a half-dozen rounds last year, but I was also there for several days with Brian Schneider in September to rebuild the diabolical green at the par-3 11th. Our friends at the PGA Tour tell us they won’t use a hole location that has more than 2% of slope; I wonder what they would have made of the middle and back tiers of the 11th, which each had 6% of slope, separated by a tier that was 9%? We wound up lowering the back of the green by more than two feet to make it all work, and I think we are right on the cusp of people thinking we didn’t do enough.”"
40,Crystal Downs,"Frankfort, MI",Alister MacKenzie/Perry Maxwell,1932,"Crystal Downs Country Club (Frankfort, Michigan)",Bill Satterfield,rev40_crystal_downs_2,"Dr. MacKenzie's work at Crystal Downs is nothing short of masterful as he created one of the holy grails for students of golf course architecture to study. The challenge on and around the greens creates the most demanding 6500 yards I've ever encountered, especially since the driving corridors are relatively generous. Nearby Arcadia Bluffs has more ""wow factor"" due to dramatic features and stunning Lake Michigan views, but Crystal Downs is a more elegant brilliance on a beautiful piece of property.

What to Expect:  Special. That is the first word that comes to mind when I reflect on Crystal Downs. Everything about Crystal Downs is special to the golfer that has developed a palate for the subtleties found in masterful architecture; architecture that challenges the mind as much as the body. Players are taken on a roller coaster of emotions as they traverse in and out of holes that range from being relatively easy to diabolically difficult to flat out brilliant. I've never played a course that I wanted to replay immediately afterwards as much as Crystal Downs. The subtleties in the design just beg you to come back and challenge again to see if you can play better the second time around. The course is short enough that you think you should be able to take advantage of it, but in the same vein as Merion, Crystal Downs demands respect and wisdom in every shot to avoid being punished more harshly than you would imagine. The speed and slope of the greens command absolute precision and will quickly expose any shortcomings you have with your putter or wedges; more so than any other course I've seen. From the pro shop and first tee you have a view of the entire front nine coupled with views of Crystal Lake; it is truly one of the most impressive panoramas in all of golf. On the back nine you are afforded glimpses of Lake Michigan and I was surprised there weren't more views of it, but the course is so good on its own that the backdrops suddenly don't matter that much. Holes 5-9 can only be rivaled by Pebble Beach as one of my all time favorite front nine stretches in golf, #13 is one of the finest and most demanding two-shotters I've had the privilege of playing, and #17 launched itself to the top of my favorite driveable par 4s. The first time around the course there might be a couple of holes that don't wow you or perhaps are drowned out due to how phenomenal other holes on the property are, but I think you'll find greater appreciation for those understated holes in subsequent loops around Crystal Downs. The course is a challenging walk given how hilly the terrain is and caddies are available through the main season though many players will elect to ride a cart. Crystal Downs may rivals Cypress Point as having the most understated pro shop and general amenities in contrast to how incredible the golf is; something I really love because it shows how the club is simply all about golf. It has nothing to do with the course itself, but it should be noted that the staff and membership are perhaps the most down to earth people I've come across at a Top 20 course and appreciate visitors who know and understand golf course architecture and the brilliance that is Crystal Downs.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  17th Hole – 311 Yard Par 4 – Crystal Downs lays claim to a handful of the finest golf holes on the planet and this is certainly one of them. The 17th at Crystal Downs is the most treacherous driveable par four you are likely to ever face. When the wind is in your face tunnelled through the trees the green becomes unreachable and players have to figure out a safe place to hit their tee ball. The fairway tilts severely from right to left and features limited good options. A tee shot that doesn't carry 180 yards will require hacking out of the junk into the fairway and effectively eliminating any birdie chance. A 200 yard tee shot will feed into a popular bowl to hit from although the angle leaves a limited view of the green. Tee shots that go deep up the left side are dead while a 250 - 280 drive towards the right greenside bunker will leave the ideal spot to hit from. 311 yards may look like a pushover on the scorecard but I have no doubt that this hole plays over par every single day of the year.

17th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (311 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  9th Hole – 175 Yards – Another brilliantly difficult hole that just doesn't seem that intimidating from the tee. While the uphill nature of the tee shot may get into some golfer's heads, it is everything around the green that should be kicking the fear in. The safe play is short right, but not so short that your ball feeds right back down the fairway. Carrying it to long on the right side and finding the bunker will result in one of the most difficult sand saves of your life given how nasty the green is at feeding balls away from the hole and back to the front edge of the green or off altogether. Anything left of the green is an instant double bogey . . . at best.

9th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (175 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  5th Hole – 353 Yards – Perhaps Crystal Downs' most acclaimed hole, the 5th is a wonderful example of not needing a ton of length to have a strategic hole with sufficient difficulty. The brilliance in any design incorporates viable options throughout rather than demanding specific shots all day long. On the 5th hole multiple options are presented off the tee since a trio of bunkers part the hogback fairway. The safest tee shot is left of the bunker but sets up a blind approach shot to a green that slopes away from the player. Hitting right of the bunkers sets up a much better angle to the green but brings a large tree into play and long ballers may have their tee shot scoot into trouble since a view of the right side of the hogback fairway is not offered. Some players may elect to stay short of the bunker trio while other may want to test their merits at carrying the spacious bunker in the waste area with a power fade that can feed the ball up near the green. The theme of difficult greens is back in full force on the 5th hole which features a severely sloped back-to-front and left-to-right surface that often feeds balls to the grass edge between the green and bunkers. Holes like this make Crystal Downs and Merion the most well designed and difficult ""short"" courses in the country.

5th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (353 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  8th Hole – 550 Yards – Another great hole and one of the most revered par fives in world. In a day and age where architects often feel they need to laden a hole with an undue amount of bunkering or hazards, Dr. MacKenzie lets Mother Earth be the star here by draping this three-shotter over a very undulated fairway that climbs uphill the whole way home. 550 yards may seem reachable for some players, but the significant uphill climb eliminates that thought for most players as they just try to figure out a good spot to hit their third shot from to attack the green. There are so many undulations throughout the wide fairway that it is useless to focus on any one particular location as a lay up zone, but I will recommend that you lay up closer to the green than your traditional ""favorite yardage"" since the uphill nature of the approach shot will add a full club to reach the small green. Perfect golf is required to birdie this hole; near perfect golf is needed for a par.

8th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (550 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  7th Hole – 335 Yard Par 4 – How could anyone ever tire of playing Crystal Downs? It is a living masterpiece and the 7th hole features on of the most unforgettable greens you'll ever play. The tee shot plays to a fairway that runs out of room about 225 yards from the tee. Most players will play short of that drop off and allow themselves a clean view of the boomerang green that lies in wait. Bolder players may elect to hit their tee shot into the swell beyond the end of the fairway and leave themselves with a shorter, but blind approach to the green. The boomerang shaped green wraps around a hill which also features a pair of sloping bunkers. If you can't have fun putting on this green to the various pin locations then you need to pick up backgammon or something because this green is a blast!

7th Hole at Crystal Downs Country Club (335 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  13th Hole – 442 Yard Par 4 – Writing this review reminds me of just how good Crystal Downs is. Each time I get to a hole to write commentary on I think, ""Oh yeah, that really was an awesome hole!"" The 13th is one of my all time favorite par fours which is saying alot considering my favorite two-shotters are generally oceanside like Pebble Beach's 8th, Cypress Point's 17th, and Maidstone's 9th.. This dogleg right calls for a fade off the tee that falls on the right half of the fairway while avoiding the forest and bunker right of the rough. A shot that comes to rest short of the right fairway bunker will be greeted by a looming tree that will block, or at a minimum alter, your approach shot into the green. Approaching this green from the left is instant death as the vast majority of balls will end up tumbling into the right greenside bunker. To say that the front-to-back and left-to-right tilt of the green is severe would be an understatement considering some might even contend it isn't fair, but that is some of the beauty of this hole. The middle of the green is divided by a ridge that causes more havoc in a green than any other I can recall. If your ball is resting on the opposite side of the ridge from the hole your chances of two-putting are quite low considering how difficult it is to even keep the ball on the green while crossing the ridge. To tame this beast with a four or better may be the most rewarding experience on the course considering it is easily the toughest par on the course. If someone told me there were more snowman scores on this hole than pars I would believe it."
41,Seminole,"Juno Beach, FL",Donald Ross,1929,Seminole Golf Club,Cal Simmons,rev41_seminole_1,"For someone that gets to Florida once a decade, playing all the great courses in the state is difficult. Particularly so when the courses are in remote areas of this large state. Seminole is on the ocean in the far southeast part. I had come to peace with the fact that I would never play what many call Donald Ross’s finest work, Seminole. Then the invitation from a friend came in. 

“We will meet Tuesday at 12:30 for lunch, play 18 in the afternoon, 36 on Wednesday and 18 on Thursday,” he said. A dream trip. It seems that after playing a great course you want another crack at it. I would have four chances to figure out how to play this gem.

I make my way down the long narrow road that also serves as access for an adjacent residential area. Ten foot high oleanders keep the course hidden from the outside world. I creep around the corner into the gravel parking lot. 

There is nothing ostentatious about Seminole. Gravel parking lot, modest clubhouse, no attendants swarming those arriving. I change shoes in the parking lot, give my clubs to the only outside services person and head to the patio for lunch. 

Once a club not welcoming to the outside world, the attitude has changed. With the televised skins game featuring PGA Tour players during the pandemic, and hosting the Walker Cup Match on May 8th and 9th, 2021, the world finally will see this fabulous course.

After a brief warm up I stand on the first tee. I am struck by how flat the course is. There are a few palm trees and no punitive rough. Sandy waste areas appear to outline many of the fairways. Bunkers define the flow of the holes. 

The course is minimalist to an extreme. Other than tee markers, flagsticks and rakes there is nothing else on the course. There are no benches, ball washers, directional markers, above ground waste cans, rest rooms. There is one spot for water on each nine, well out of play and partially hidden in the bushes. It’s a clean look that is refreshing. 

The only refreshment stand is after hole nine, located on the lower level of the clubhouse.

While the first hole appears benign, we learn quickly that this course is going to be about iron shots into the greens, being on the correct side of the hole and judging distance control. 

“By the time we finish four rounds you will appreciate the precision required on each hole,” my host says to me. How prophetic that was.

Rumor has it that during a regrassing project over 50 years ago many of the humps, bumps and rolls disappeared. However, what remains are 18 of the most demanding green complexes I have seen. A ball hit to the wrong side of the hole location can trickle off into a bunker or 50 yards down a slope into a waste area. 

Often a drive to the wrong side of the fairway will leave a shot requiring such distance control and accuracy that even the finest players are challenged. 

Local knowledge is important. Knowing where the deep section of the green is or where not to have the ball land can mean the difference between par and double bogey. The superior caddies take care of the knowledge component. 

The sand based greens are firm and fast, maybe the fastest I have ever played. 

A forty foot high sand dune runs along the far side of the course. Another is along the ocean side. Ross uses the dunes brilliantly. What appears from the first tee to be a flat course with little interesting topography is anything but. 

Thirteen holes use the dunes. While the sandy waste areas in the flat are firm sand, off the fairway the dunes sand is sink your feet in soft. This leaves a wayward shot into the dunes sand all but unplayable, plugged after missing the fairway. 

The holes that do not use the dunes have challenging green complexes with false fronts, tight bunkering and greens sloping in all directions. 

Water flows in and out of ponds in the middle of the property. With firm fairways and little rough a ball heading toward the water will not stop, no matter how much pleading the player exerts. 

Holes run in every direction. No back and forth here. This generates interesting challenges because the wind blows nearly constantly and from day to day in every direction.

Famously, Ben Hogan would spend time at Seminole preparing for the Masters. Just like Augusta National, Seminole demands strategic positioning off the tee with accurate iron shots to the greens. 

Rumor has it that his favorite hole was the sixth, an uphill par four to a well bunkered green running diagonally away from the player. The green is somewhat remindful of the 12th at Augusta, with the carry required to the right portion of the green longer than the left. 

Tipping out at 7320, the challenge for all players is to hit the ball high enough to hold the firm, fast, elevated greens, while controlling the distance to the correct position on the green. 

Modern architecture features wide fairways. Players want to find their ball. However, the great courses have always had wide fairways. Augusta National, Pine Valley, Sand Hills, to name a few. The fairways are generous at Seminole. 

Starting at the second hole the course moves up and around the major sand dune on the course. The holes are challenging, bunkers deep and the greens severe. The teeth of the course are the holes on and around the dunes. 

Ross gives the player a breather on the flat holes 8-10, until going back up the dune at numbers 11 thru 14. The course finishes with the challenging 16th green, terrific short down hill par three 17th and fun shortish par 4, 18th. 

Not that the breather holes are easy. An errant shot to a green can quickly turn into a double bogey or worse. 

One of the most difficult holes to build is a great uphill par three. Having a green with character visible from the tee, along with creative bunkering, is rarely seen. 

The 13th is just such a par 3. Another green that diagonally moves away from the player, two large bunkers ominously await the errant shot that hangs to the right. 

Not to be missed at Seminole is the locker room. It’s as large an open locker room as I have ever seen. Jack Burke and Jimmy Demerit patterned some aspects of the locker room at Champions Golf Club in Houston after Seminole, as have other clubs. 

With ceilings 25’ high or higher, the winners of the club tournaments are painted on the large wooden plaques around the room. It is a room filled with character and history. The floor creeks under the carpet as I walk, gazing up at the names on the wall. 

Nearly 100 years old, it has wooden lockers around the perimeter, with a large comfortable seating area in the middle. I think about the great players listed on the walls above, walking the same floors.

Another highlight of Seminole is the golf staff, headed by the dean of PGA Professionals in the US.  Bob Ford has trained and had many of his assistants be selected to be head professionals at some of the finest courses in the country. The sincere attitude and level of service provided adds to the enjoyment of a day at Seminole. 

It was a thrill to see and play Seminole. I owe my host a big debt of gratitude for inviting me. I would love to go back again. While we caught two great days with little wind in the morning, typically it blows around 20 mph or stronger. 

“I couldn’t keep my hat on my head the last time I was here,” said my friend. The wind, the firm and lightning fast green complexes make Seminole what it is, a great course that is difficult. 

It was a special trip to see Seminole. I would love to go back again in A Life In Golf. "
42,Seminole,"Juno Beach, FL",Donald Ross,1929,Ari’s Course Reviews: Seminole Golf Club,Ari Techner,rev42_seminole_2,"Like all of us, I am excited for the return of golf to TV on Sunday as DJ, Rory, Rickie, and Matt Wolff tee it up at Seminole for a charity match. Seminole is a very special place and one that most don’t get a chance to see, so it’s very exciting that they have opened their doors for this match and allowed the whole world to watch.

Seminole Golf Club opened in 1929 and was designed by Donald Ross. The course is consistently ranked as the best course in Florida and one of the best in the country. It is generally considered to be Ross’ best course along with Pinehurst No. 2.

The course is situated on a squarish 140-acre piece of land that sits in between Ocean Ave. on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. There are two large north-south running dune ridges—a 40-foot dune to the west side of the property and a smaller dune on the east edge along the ocean—that define the property. Ross uses these dunes to great effect in shaping the holes. In fact, 13 of 18 holes are directly influenced by these dunes.

The lower elevation parts of the property are actually below sea level and feature a few drainage ponds and canals to shuttle water away from the turf. The routing is quite exceptional in its variety and uses every inch of this small property to its advantage. Each hole runs a slightly different direction which makes it difficult on this very windy site to always determine the exact direction of the wind.

A recent restoration by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw has returned the bunkering to its original Ross glory as well as opened up old sandy waste areas on the dunes that had been lost to time. The course was also worked on in the mid-late 1940s by Dick Wilson, who brought the course back after WW2. Despite being worked on by these other architects, Seminole is considered very true to its original Donald Ross design and one of the most authentic Ross courses left in the country.

The course is famously difficult despite its moderately short length, though new back tees now stretch it to over 7,300 yards. The main defense of the course is its small, contoured greens and its many bunkers, often deep and treacherous, especially around the greens. Ben Hogan famously used to practice here to get ready for The Masters. Similar to Augusta, this is largely a second-shot golf course where positioning on the greens relative to the hole location is key for success.


Like a lot of older, classic courses, and typical of Ross, it’s always best to be below the hole and anyone who finds themselves past the hole or especially over the green are in for a very tough next shot or lag putt. This is made more difficult by the firm and fast greens that are hard to hold on all but the best-struck shots. It has a reasonable mix of shot requirements into the greens with many requiring an aerial shot and a few holes where you can use the typically firm turf to run the ball up onto the green.

The course is a real treat to play, especially if you like windy, firm, and fast golf.


Official Seminole scorecard. The pros will play from championship tees beyond the gold.

Seminole Golf Club: Hole by hole
The 1st hole is a mid-length par 4 that starts down in the low area by the clubhouse and is a gentle handshake of a start. The fairway is flat with bunkers staggered on both sides and the green tilts away from the line of play with bunkers left and right but open in the front.

The 2nd is a longer par 4 that gives you your first introduction to the dune ridge to the west. A new back tee makes the carry over the water about 240 yards. The fairway is flanked by bunkers and the first sandy waste area up on the left. The real fun is at the green, which is set up into the dune ridge, is surrounded by bunkers and is extremely difficult.

The 3rd is a dogleg-right par 5 that’s reachable for long hitters. The tee sits up on the dune ridge and the tee shot drops down back to the flat part of the property. The tee shot is over the sandy waste area and a set of bunkers set into the fairway. The green is set back on top of the dune and slopes hard back to front. I once watched a player who has won multiple amateur major championships hit this green in two and then putt off the green into the front bunker.

The 4th is a par 4 that plays along the top of the dune ridge to a fairway that serpents through fairway bunkers and sandy waste area set on both sides. The green is slightly elevated and slopes off on all sides.

The 5th is the first par 3. It is typically a mid-iron to a small, rounded green that is completely surrounded by six deep bunkers. Always a tough target to hit and hold.

The 6th is a hole that was singled out by Hogan as one of his favorites. A shorter par 4 of a little under 400 yards, the fairway is squeezed between the out of bounds property line of trees on the right and a sandy waste area on the left and is flanked by bunkers on both sides. A line of three bunkers coming off the right side of the green cut into the middle of the fairway short of the green to about 75 yards. The slightly uphill, hourglass-shaped green tilts to the left and away from the line of play and is very hard to judge and hold.


6th hole. VERY difficult up and down from that bunker. Will do well just to hold the green from there.

The 7th plays from an elevated tee on the dune ridge down to a flatter fairway flanked by bunkers on both sides. There’s water fronting the green which is also flanked on both sides by bunkers.

The 8th is a long par 3 that plays slightly uphill to a large green that is open in front allowing a run-up shot if hit towards the middle of the green. A longer shot to one of the bigger greens on the course. Four bunkers around the green catch any stray stray balls hit in their direction.

The 9th is a par 5 that is pretty straight playing along the boundary line of the property. There is a little water canal that creeps in on the left side and then pinches the fairway. There are bunkers on both sides staggered up the fairway from tee to green. The green itself is small, flanked by a single bunker on both sides, and extremely contoured, especially on the front—another hole where you can run the ball onto the green.

The 10th heads back away from the clubhouse and is back down on the lower, flatter land. A classic cape hole, there’s water left off the tee that also wraps around the front and left of the small, contoured green. It’s the third hole in a row where you can use the firm turf and contours to run the ball onto the green, though I doubt you will see anyone do that Sunday!

The 11th is a long, tough par 4. The tee shot is over a water hazard that also wraps around the right side of the fairway. The approach shot is uphill and partially blind to a narrow green surrounded by trouble. One of the harder holes on the course.


Heading up the hill towards the difficult 11th green.

The 12th is a very interesting, mid-length par 4. The tee shot is downhill off the dune ridge to a fairway with a little canal of water left and a couple of bunkers towards the end of the fairway to make the longer hitters think a bit. This green is just diabolical with a very narrow front section and six bunkers surrounding it. This is my personal favorite green on the course.


The diabolical 12th green. My favorite on the course.

The 13th is a fantastic par 3 that plays directly at the ocean. Another small target to hit especially with a lot of wind, the green tilts left to right and the green is surrounded by nine bunkers. The green sits on top of the eastern dune ridge and is set right at the edge of the beach. This is Seminole’s version of a reverse redan.


The reverse redan 13th. Hitting directly at the ocean and usually into a stiff breeze.

The 14th is the first of two par 5s in a row and is very reachable for the longer hitter. The fairway landing area is flanked by bunkers on both sides and there’s water left of the bunkers that rides the left side as well as another water hazard on the right near the landing area for many players layup shot. The green is small and surrounded by bunkers. It is set up back up on the dune ridge again.

The 15th is a hole that I really like. It is a mid-length par 5 with two different fairway options off the tee. The right fairway is more narrow, requires a longer carry over water and has a row of trees and bunkers on the left side. The water you have to carry off the tee also wraps around the right side of the fairway. Hitting it here makes the hole play shorter and provides a better, more open angle into the green for the player trying to reach in two. The left side is a much shorter carry over the water and has a little more room but provides a longer next shot with a worse angle. A very interesting and strategic hole that plays very different day to day based on different wind direction and intensity.

The 16th is mid-length, dogleg-right par 4 that plays to a fairway with a sharp right bend to it. The inside of the dogleg has five bunkers to catch the aggressive long hitter who takes the better line into the green. The green is again small and very hard to hold with 4 deep bunkers to penalize misses.


The approach shot into the 16th green. The first of a great stretch of 3 finishing holes.

The 17th is an all-world, short to mid-length par 3 where you are happy just to hit and hold the green. The tee is set next to the beach and offers one of the best views on the course. The green is extremely narrow and surrounded by seven deep bunkers that make par very difficult. The green is very hard to hold even with a short club in your hands. Par feels like an accomplishment on this one especially when the wind is up.


The 17th green. One of the hardest greens to hit in golf with a short to mid-iron in your hands.

The 18th tee also offers a great view of the ocean. The hole is a mid-length, dogleg-left par 4. The tee shot plays downhill to a fairway that slopes and bounces right and is once again flanked by bunkers on both sides. The approach shot is back uphill to a green sitting on the dune ridge that is surrounded by deep bunkers and generally slopes back to front and left to right. A great finishing hole.

A day playing golf at Seminole is not one to be missed. It’s one of the best golf experiences in the country and easily my favorite course in Florida. The facilities are top-notch and it has my favorite locker room in golf. The diagram of Claude Harmon’s course record round is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen and it’s a testament to the course and its lasting challenge that his course record still stands.

I’ve been lucky enough to play the course a number of times over the years, and I can say that the work that Coore/Crenshaw and the club have done here is fantastic. The bunkers are much better than ever before and I absolutely love the look of the sandy waste areas that have been brought back as well as all the new, long views from up on the dune ridge where you can nearly see the whole course.

I am extremely excited to watch these four guys on Sunday take on this course in a way that most of us never could. I’m sure they will pull off some amazing shots and moments, but I’ll bet that Seminole proves once again it cannot simply be overpowered with length. Cheers to the club for opening their doors to all of us for this event, and let’s all enjoy golf being back on TV this Sunday!

43,The Country Club (Clyde/Squirrel),"Brookline, MA",TCC Members/Willie Campbell,1899,The Country Club (Clyde & Squirrel),top100golfcourses,rev43_the_country_club_1,"The Country Club in Brookline played host to the 1999 Ryder Cup matches between the USA and Europe. Team Captains were Ben Crenshaw (US) and Mark James (Europe). For the third successive time, a single point decided the Ryder Cup, which was dubbed the “Battle of Brookline”. Europe hoped for a third successive win and required only four points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday, but the Americans rallied and easily won the first six matches to take the lead. Europe’s chances rested on Jose-Maria Olazabal, who was battling with Justin Leonard. On the 17th, Leonard holed an unlikely long birdie putt that resulted in a premature US Team celebration, which deeply upset the Europeans. Unfortunately Olazabal missed his shorter putt for a half on 17 but went on to a birdie the last to halve the match. USA 14 ½ - Europe 13 ½. The Ryder Cup was played at Valderrama in 1997 and at The Belfry in 2002.

The name may sound a little arrogant and for golfers in the know, there’s no need to explain that THE Country Club was the first of its type in the USA. It’s set in the charming heart of New England but to be precise it’s located in the suburbs of Brookline, Boston Massachusetts.

Apparently there was talk of forming The Country Club way back in 1860, but the Civil War (in part) interrupted proceedings – the club was eventually formed in 1882. Soon afterwards, golf arrived in the shape of a simple 6-hole layout, which was soon extended to 9 holes by Willie Campbell. In December 1894, the Country Club became one of the five founder members of the American Golf Association, which was subsequently renamed the United States Golf Association. The other four charter members were: Newport Country Club, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, St. Andrew's Golf Club (Yonkers, N.Y.), and Chicago Golf Club.

By 1910, golf had caught on in the Boston area and the course was extended to a full 18 holes. Little did they know that three years later, a defining moment in American golf would take place in the shape of the 1913 US Open, which saw amateur Francis Ouimet – a young, unknown twenty-year-old and a former caddy at the Country Club – defeat the legendary professionals, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in an exciting 18-hole play-off. Ouimet’s victory injected huge interest in golf in the United States and it gave hope to ordinary Americans by proving that normal people could achieve success alongside those who were more financially fortunate.

The 27 holes in play today at The Country Club were constructed at different times with input from numerous architects. Francis Ouimet won the US Open on the original course (Clyde & Squirrel), but the modern-day championship layout consists of fifteen holes of the original eighteen, with four holes from William Flynn's Primrose nine-hole loop (two Primrose holes are combined to make one tough and long tournament par four).

In 2009, Gil Hanse was entrusted to deliver a Master Plan for the restoration of all 27 holes."

Location: Brookline, Massachusetts

History: You can make the argument that no other course in America has a richer or more important history than The Country Club. This legendary Club was one of the first country clubs in America and was founded by prominent Bostonians on January 14, 1882 after they had splintered from the Myopia Club. Golf didn’t arrive until 1893, when three members (Hunnewell, Bacon, and Curtis) successfully petitioned the board and created a 6 hole loop. Only one hole remains from this rudimentary design, the par 3 7th. In 1894, Scottish pro Willie Campbell completed the 9 hole design and more notably, The Country Club became a founding member of the USGA along with Shinnecock, Chicago, St. Andrews (NY), and Newport. By 1899, Willie Campbell had created 9 additional holes to make it a full 18. In 1902, the new pro Alex “Nipper” Campbell lengthened the course and it hosted its first national championship, the U.S. Women’s Amateur.

In 1927, famed architect William Flynn arrived at Brookline to design a third 9 holes and restore the original 18. His new 9, known as the the Primrose Course, contributes three holes to the current day Championship Course. Throughout the years, many architects have renovated the course in anticipation for national championships including Geoffrey Cornish in the 1960s, Rees Jones in the 1980s, and most recently Gil Hanse in the 2010s.

The Country Club is best known for hosting numerous national and state championships, most famously the 1913 U.S. Open, in which local caddie and amateur Francis Ouimet stunned the world by beating British heavyweights Ted Ray and Harry Vardon in extra holes. Ouimet’s victory is credited with popularizing golf in the US and is the subject of the movie The Greatest Game Ever Played. The Country Club’s second most famous moment came at the 1999 Ryder Cup when the US came back from 4 points down on Sunday at the “Battle at Brookline” with a 45-foot putt from Justin Leonard on the 17th hole. The Country Club is tied with Merion for most U.S. Amateurs (1910, 1922, 1934, 1957, 1982, and 2013) and has long been a champion of women’s golf, hosting the U.S. Women’s Amateur three times (1902, 1941, and 1995). Additional U.S. Opens hosted at The Country Club include 1963, 1988, and 2022. Accolades for this storied Club include:

Hole Descriptions: My expectations for The Country Club were sky-high as I passed through the gate guarded by a mannikin named “Woody.” Long considered the crown jewel of New England golf, I knew I was in for an incredible day. The parkland design features three sets of 9 holes – Clyde, Squirrel, and Primrose, but the members primarily play the Clyde/Squirrel Course, which is what we played. For U.S. Opens and other championships, the Primrose Course contributes three and a half difficult holes and subtracts three holes from the Main Course (9, 10, and 12). Similar to other top parkland designs I’ve played (Philly Cricket Club, Quaker Ridge, etc), the design was very fair and embodies the term “hard par, easy bogey.” The history and atmosphere at Brookline are absolutely top 20 and maybe even top 5 in America, and while I loved the course, I’m not sure it has the “wow” factor I expect from a top 20 course.

Two major features stand out from my round at The Country Club. The first is small greens. Brookline’s greens are easily the smallest I’ve ever played and are surrounded by thick rough and bunkers. There’s a lot of variety in hole length here, but truthfully it doesn’t matter much when you’re chipping greenside on most holes. This is absolutely a design where the golfer with the best short game and strategy beats the bomber every time, and this has borne out in its U.S. Open history. The second feature which really struck me was how much change the course goes through all the time. While I was playing, the groundscrew was adding and subtracting areas to greens and making other alterations to the course. In truth, The Country Club has been in flux since it opened to stay relevant for national championships, but I found this interesting because I imagined a course with a reputation for being conservative would be reticent to such changes. I know at my course, taking down one tree is a fight, but The Country Club’s lack of a central design figure (Willie Campbell is no Ross or Tillinghast) has successfully allowed it to adapt since 1893.

The opening hole is the longest par 4 on the course at 441 yards. This difficult dogleg left is lined by the practice green to the right and range on your left so you can guarantee there will be eyes on you as you tee off. Two bunkers line the left side of the dogleg  between 220 and 250 yards and longer hitters can carry them. This green runs back-to-front and is surrounded by three bunkers on either side.

The straightaway 1st – “Polo Fields”
The 2nd hole is the first of several very short par fours at just 285 yards. This hole plays as a difficult long par 3 in U.S. Opens, but for the members is a nice opportunity for birdie. This wide fairway ends at about 220 yards and the hole runs uphill and to the left after this point. Two giant bunkers guard well short of this tiny table-top green while deep greenside ones line short and left.

The 2nd – “Cottage” is more natural as a par 4
The beautiful approach at 2
At a strong 429 yards, the number 1 handicap 3rd hole is my favorite at The Country Club and undoubtedly one of the best fours in the world. This is an extremely quirky design, playing straight downhill on the drive to a wide fairway that narrows into a funnel between two giant mounds. From this common landing area, the hole plays flatter to a tiny green surrounded by numerous hazards. Bunkers occupy either side of the green, while additional bunkers litter each side for the final 70 yards. A pond lines the right side of the fairway about 70 yards short of the green and another pond looms long for those who misclub. Just a fantastic golf hole and one you won’t soon forget.

The unique fairway at 3 reminds me of Eastward Ho!’s 6th

If quirk is your thing, then you’ll love the par 4 4th, another short hole at just 324 yards. This unique hole features two separate teeboxes that greatly affects the way you play the hole. The lower, original teebox plays at the bottom of a hollow and plays straight over a giant mound of fescue, making the drive completely blind. A second teebox, added by William Flynn, plays level to the mound and allows you to go for the green with driver. We played the lower teebox, and I must say it’s one of the most intimidating teeshots you’ll ever face, even though you’re hitting iron. This hole is named “Hospital” and I wonder if that’s a clever reference to fate of those who don’t carry this cliff. The fairway here is initially generous but narrows at about 210 yards with bunkers on the left. This approach demands precision, as the green is one of the smallest on the course lined by six narrow, deep bunkers.

Apparently Francis Ouimet was terrified of this teeshot and I don’t blame him
The tenuous approach at 4
The 5th hole continues alternating long and short par fours at a strong 419 yards. This dogleg right plays over numerous mounds and requires a leap of faith as you try to carry them. A pair of bunkers ends the fairway about 60 yards short of the green, while two deep bunkers lines just left of the green. This is one of the more severe greens on the course with a serious right-to-left tilt.

The strategic par 4 5th – “Newton”
The approach at 5
At just 280 yards, the half par 6th hole is the shortest par 4 at The Country Club. With OB and a trio of bunkers lining the right, this reachable hole plays uphill the entire way towards a minuscule green. Four giant bunkers guard just short, and I imagine are a common destination for those trying for the green.

The par 4 6th – “Bakers”
There are only three par threes at The Country Club and you have to wait until the 7th hole to reach the first one. At 179 yards, this is the longest and also the best of the trio. The only remaining hole from the 1893 design, this one-shotter plays over open terrain to a larger green guarded by cavernous bunkers and steep slopes on either side. Many of the greens at The Country Club are subtle, but not this one, which features a double plateau and several tricky undulations.

The long par 3 7th – “Plateau”
The 371 yard 8th hole is a nice tree-lined par 4 running downhill from the teebox to an undulating fairway lined by trees on the left and a trio of bunkers down the right beginning at 230 yards. This approach runs back uphill to a heavily back-to-front sloped green lined by four deep bunkers on either side.

The downhill par 4 8th – “Corner”
Walking up the 8th green
The first hole to be left off of the Championship Course is the par 4 9th. At 418 yards, this straightaway hole is probably the most forgettable hole on the course with an open teeshot to an uphill fairway lined by bunkers on either side around 200 yards. A relatively flat green is lined by three bunkers left and a steep slope behind that leads to a parking lot.

The uphill par 4 9th – “Paddock”
At just 310 yards, the par 4 10th is another short hole that’s a bit too easy for a U.S. Open. Despite its short length, this is an incredibly quirky design that can lead to big numbers quickly. Your drive must first navigate a field goal of trees to a tight fairway lined by prominent bunkers on the left at 120 and 165 yards and right at 175 yards. Trees begin down the right after the bunker and may block the green, even from the right fairway. The left is the preferred miss with the only real issue being rough on this side. At about 215 yards, the fairway ends with a giant bunker and rough guarding short of a tiny green. In true old school fashion, the front of this green is almost completely obscured by a mound. This is certainly an interesting hole, but I’m not sure how I feel about it.

The view from the 10th teebox
A look at the unique hazards surrounding the 10th green
The Country Club only features two par fives, but they certainly aren’t lacking in quality. The 11th hole is not only one of the best holes on the course, but easily one of the best par fives I’ve ever played. At 503 yards, this hole reminds me of the fantastic 4th at Bethpage Black as a long, winding, uphill double dogleg. The teeshot plays downhill over a pond split down the middle with a neat walking bridge. Nicknamed “Himalayas,” this hole is notable for its glacial rock forms which prominently narrow the fairway at about 240 yards. Those short of the rocks will have a blind second shot, while longer hitters will be able to aim left over them. The lay-up here plays back uphill over a creek about 150 yards short of the green. While reachable for some, this green sits at the far right corner on a pedestal guarded short by numerous deep bunkers.

The par 5 11th
Walking up to the secluded 11th green
A look back down the 11th fairway
The short par 3 12th is the third and final hole left of the U.S. Open course, but I hear this might be changing in 2022. I sincerely hope this is the case, as it’d be a joy to watch the pros struggle with this little devil. At just 125 yards, this is a true do-or-die hole in the same sense as the 7th at Pebble Beach or 3rd at Wannamoisett. Distance control is a must to find this tiny green, but the fact that the hole plays downhill makes this a bit more challenging. Curiously nicknamed “Redan,” this green features a primarily back-to-front slope and is surrounded by beautiful bunkers short and left. There are more 5’s than 2’s here.

The signature par 3 12th
The par 4 13th is another strong hole playing straightaway at 400 yards. Heavily tree-lined, this hole requires a forced carry of about 130 yards to an uphill fairway that plateaus at about 240 yards. A hidden crossbunker down the right at 240 yards is to be avoided and was only recently added by Gil Hanse. The approach here is one of the most beautiful on the course with water down the right and a back-to-front sloped green guarded by two bunkers short.

The blind par 4 13th – “Stockton”
HJTF2839
The picturesque approach at 13
After a quick detour through the Primrose Course, the final five holes are the same for both the Main Course and U.S. Open rota beginning with the par 5 14th. At 510 yards, this is the longest hole at The Country Club and another nice hole. This broad, sweeping dogleg left features mounds of rough lining both sides of an undulating fairway. While the drive is fairly inviting, this approach narrows considerably towards an elevated green guarded by a tremendous false front. I am embarrassed to say I never actually completed this hole despite being 70 yards out lying two after having the ball roll back to my feet at least five times.

The par 5 14th – “Quarry”
MAHM8429
The very challenging approach at 14
The 15th is another terrific hole and one of my favorites on the course. Playing downhill and straightaway, this 417 yard beaut traverses a rocky terrain on the teeshot to a generous fairway lined by OB left and the majestic yellow clubhouse on the right. The Club’s driveway bisects the fairway at 270 yards and longer hitters may want to think twice before nailing driver into a Bentley or BMW. This approach plays flat and open into a larger, relatively flat green guarded by bunkers on three sides.

The par 4 15th – “Liverpool”
At 169 yards, the 16th hole is the final par 3 on the course, and undoubtedly one of the weaker holes. This medium-length one-shotter plays alongside the entrance towards a small green guarded by four bunkers short and on either side.

The par 3 16th partially hidden by shadows
The excellent 17th hole will live in the history books forever as the deciding hole in the 1913 and 1963 U.S. Opens and 1999 Ryder Cup. This slender 365 yard dogleg left isn’t the longest hole in the world, but it’s bunkered terrifically with four giant bunkers (AKA Vardon’s bunkers) down the inside elbow of the dogleg ranging from 190 to 260 yards. Those who stray right will find thick rough and fescue. This green is one of the narrowest on the course guarded by a tall tree to the right and multiple deep bunkers on both sides. Try to recreate Justin Leonard’s putt so you have an appreciation at how impressive it was!

At 396 yards, the difficult closing hole is another where a right-to-left ballflight is preferred. This gently treed dogleg left turns slightly at about 230 yards with hidden bunkers down the left. From here, the approach must carry a cavernous principal’s nose bunker short to a small circular green that runs hard back-to-front. The green surrounding gives off an almost amphitheatre feel perfect for major tournaments.

General Comments: The Country Club certainly lives up to its name, as there is so much more than just golf for members to enjoy. It’s a leading social club of Boston, and just a quarter of its 1300 members golf. The campus itself is more akin to an Ivy League school than traditional clubhouse, with many stately yellow and brick buildings reminding you you’re in New England. Members enjoy skeet shooting, squash, swimming, tennis, ice skating, and numerous other amenities year-round. The Men’s Locker Room is more or less a mausoleum to American golf with plenty of memorabilia including the original stimpmeter. Practice facilities include a driving range wedged between the 1st and 18th holes, and a large putting and practice green adjacent to the 1st tee.

The range at The Country Club
The Country Club (rightly) gets a reputation for its intense privacy and exclusivity, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much of a true family club it is. The commitment to women’s golf is particularly strong, and this is unusual for a club from its era. Brookline’s roster includes Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, who famously were denied entry for many years before finally being admitted in 2015. The greatest quarterback of all time lives on the course and apparently Gisele is the primary member. I had the pleasure of meeting Fernando during my visit, the longtime bartender who makes the world-famous “Fernando” cocktail. I highly recommend this rum float-like drink if you get the chance.

A look at the buildings surrounding the 18th green
Verdict: The history, atmosphere, and amenities at the The (original) Country Club are second to pretty much no one, while the excellent parkland design provides an engaging routing with plenty of variety and standout holes. As length renders many classic courses obsolete, the strategic bunkering and tiny greens here make this a true championship venue that has withstood the test of time. This goes without saying, but an invitation to this ultra-exclusive Club is still one of the most cherished in American golf – just as it’s been for over a century."
45,San Francisco,"San Francisco, CA",A.W. Tillinghast,1918,A Walk into the Past: San Francisco GC,Phillip Johnson,rev45_san_francisco_1,"Golf, like most everything, has been revolutionized, dominated, and overrun by the emergence of technology. There are positives and negatives to the state of today’s game versus the game our grandfathers and their grandfathers played. Technological advancements in equipment have undeniably made the game easier and more enjoyable for most players. The ball flies longer and straighter, woods are larger yet lighter, and irons use perimeter weighting to ensure the toe-ball you just hit still carries the junk. At golf courses, technology has allowed conditioning to reach new levels. Golfers have grown to expect immaculate fairways and greens, and bunkers raked to perfection. Rangefinders give us the exact yardage, not only to the hole, but to lips of traps and branches of trees. In the same breath, technology has taken away from the experience of golf. Smartphones have made avoiding a phone call, text, email or tweet virtually impossible. When the pace of play is slow, it’s easy to open the social media of your choice and start scrolling. One way or another, we often rob ourselves of the full experience of golf.

Never before have I experienced pure golf as I did this fall at San Francisco Golf Club. It’s a true golf club; there is no pool, no tennis courts, and a strict no cell phone policy. It keeps the distractions away and the focus on golf. Entering SFGC feels like entering a time machine. The inconspicuous entrance leads through the trees to a small parking lot. The men’s locker room features a wood-burning fireplace that is aflame before 7 a.m. and original, wooden lockers from 1915. It feels as if A.W. Tillinghast himself could round the corner to greet you at any moment.

As you would guess, there are no carts available. Even further, caddies are mandatory. At SFGC, the game is meant to be played as it was in 1915. It means rangefinders are not allowed, and your caddie won’t have one either. If you think that’s tough, wait until you come to realize that there are no distance markers on the course – none at all. The caddies are familiar with the course and will eyeball the yardages for you and tell you how to play the shot (this gets more confusing if you haven’t dealt with the San Francisco marine layer, which makes the ball go considerably shorter). The caddies will tell you everything you are used to getting from your rangefinder. Are they as accurate? Of course not, but this is how the game was played when this iconic track was constructed, and the club has preserved the guesswork, feel, and player-caddie relationship that is now absent in other courses. Playing without exact yardages at a course you have never seen is significantly more difficult than I could have imagined. My playing partner, Ryan, and I estimated it was a full three shots more difficult, especially because SFGC happens to be very hilly. The elevation changes, coupled with the fact that it is a strategic masterpiece (meaning well-placed bunkers on the inside of doglegs, amongst other things), meant that we had to put serious thought into every shot. There were no easy decisions as every shot presented its unique risks and rewards based on your angle of entry. San Francisco GC isn’t insanely difficult (73.6/133 from 6,836 yards), yet I cannot remember playing a golf course that required more thought than this one. It rewards good strategy and execution and punishes the opposite. Is that not how golf is meant to be?

I could write thousands of words about the excellence of San Francisco Golf Club’s design. It was strategic, featured no weak holes, had immaculate conditioning and left nothing to be desired. The artistic bunkering looked like Tillinghast had Alister MacKenzie hanging over his shoulder during construction. Somehow none of these aspects were my most vivid takeaway from my visit. I learned, or perhaps relearned, what made me fall in love with the game of golf. While on the course, nothing outside of it had to exist for the time being. It was just my group and the golf course. I only worried about how much club to take, only had to find answers to questions like how I could two-putt from over a massive ridge, and only feared that the round would eventually come to an end. While walking a golf course that looked like it belonged to the land rather than forced into it, my only distraction was the conversation with a good friend that I met through – you guessed it – golf."
46,San Francisco,"San Francisco, CA",A.W. Tillinghast,1918,San Francisco,top100golfcourses,rev46_san_francisco_2,"Albert Warren Tillinghast was probably the greatest American golf course architect of his day and “Tilly” was the genius who crafted San Francisco in 1915.

“Now Tillinghast’s genius was being given free rein and it shone brightly out in California as well, at the San Francisco Golf Club.” Wrote Philip Young in the book entitled: Tillinghast – Creator of Golf Courses. “There are those who, to this day, after viewing all of his great courses, believe this to be his finest work.”

Situated close to Golden Gate Bridge, the course was not only the first remarkable example of the great architect’s craft, it was also the first course of any real quality to be constructed on the West Coast of America.

Laid out on a rolling pine-forested landscape near Lake Merced, the course stretches out across a number of valleys and ravines with the front nine occupying the most dramatic terrain. It’s here that one of Tilly’s favourite holes, the appropriately named par three 7th “Duel Hole,” is located.

This short hole is situated on the site of the last legal duel in American history (when a Supreme Court Justice shot and killed a US Senator in 1859) and it plays downhill to a small kidney-shaped green that drops off to the right.

The par three 13th hole (recently restored by Tom Doak’s Renaissance Golf Design firm) is another great one-shotter on a back nine that finishes, like the outward half, with a wonderful par five hole. With no cart paths or yardage markers to distract on the fairways, a round here with a member at San Francisco is one to savour.

The following comments were kindly provided by Tom Doak:

About 8-9 years ago we rebuilt all of the greens at SFGC in order to combat nematode infestation which had gone beyond the bounds of chemical control. We had to rebuild some of the greenside bunkers as part of that, and at the same time, we restored a few fairway bunkers that had been filled over the years, on holes 1 and 17. We added back tees on holes 2, 3, 6, and 9 as well.

About 5 years ago, we rebuilt holes 13-14-15 to the original Tillinghast design. Those three holes had been completely re-routed in 1949-50 by a local club professional, Harold Sampson, when the highway on the eastern boundary of the course was being expanded.

It's a bit hard to describe exactly what we did, without knowing which version of the course you are familiar with. This restoration was a cause of some heavy political infighting at the club: almost none of the members remembered the course prior to 1949, so to them it was a redesign, and a few of the opponents of the project are still critics of the work, even though no one has argued that what we did wasn't true to form."
47,Southern Hills,"Tulsa, OK",Perry Maxwell,1936,Southern Hills (Championship),top100golfcourses,rev47_southern_hills_1,"“24 hours from Tulsa” is one of Burt Bacharach’s more famous songs. We’re not sure why it took so long to get to Oklahoma but we’re sure it was worth it in the end, especially if you can befriend a member and secure a tee time at Southern Hills Country Club.

Southern Hills was founded by a group of rich local business during the Great Depression and they commissioned Perry Maxwell, a local Oklahoman, to design the course and it opened for play in 1935.

""Despite its name"", wrote Mike Stachura in American Classic Courses, ""Southern Hills is not a course of dramatic elevation change. Although the 1st and 10th tees are elevated and the 9th and 18th greens are well above the fairway, the remainder of the course is more flattish than not. In short, the topography here does not lend itself to breather holes. Indeed, for championship play the only par fives are the unreachable 655-yard 5th and the 537-yard 13th with water guarding the front of the green.""

According to Tom Doak's The Confidential Guide to Golf Courses Vol 2, ""The routing is chock full of doglegs well defended by trees, and the lack of space to lengthen it significantly has meant that the world's best seldom hit driver, but still face difficult approach shots to Maxwell's tilted greens. Once you move away from the hill by the clubhouse, the undulations are superb and Maxwell capitalized on them all.""

There’s nothing flash about Southern Hills. Mature deciduous trees line many of the Bermuda grass fairways and the rough is notoriously thick and tangly. Apart from the rough and 7,481 championship yards, Southern Hills is there for the taking. But not for long.

In 2018 it was announced that Gil Hanse would spearhead an extensive project aimed at restoring Perry Maxwell’s classic design as part of a $19m facility upgrade. The four-time PGA Championship host, and three-time US Open venue underwent an extensive, 10-month upgrade that finished in June 2019.

All the greens were rebuilt with an underground hydronic system to allow the cooling or heating of putting surfaces as required, with a new bent grass called Pure Distinction utilized to provide firm and fast playing conditions. Bunkers were also reconstructed with a more natural style, replacing the deep, saucer-shaped versions that had evolved down the years.

The course was lengthened by more than 450 yards and the course rating (from the back tees) rose from 76.8 to 78.2 but the slope rating actually fell from 144 to 142, meaning it’s slightly more playable for the average golfer but more difficult for the scratch golfer. Drainage creeks that previously ran underground were also opened up on many holes.

Trees were cleared on the left side of the par four 2nd, creating a split fairway that was shown to exist previously in old aerial photographs, and cart paths were hidden on many of the holes, improving the visual aspect from the tee boxes. The only non-Maxwell green on the course at No. 7 was re-positioned next to a creek with new waterfalls, and trees were removed to accommodate the fairway shifting to the right."
48,Southern Hills,"Tulsa, OK",Perry Maxwell,1936,"Southern Hills Country Club (Tulsa, Oklahoma)",Bill Satterfield,rev48_southern_hills_2,"Southern Hills is a classic major championship layout in the same category as Winged Foot, Baltusrol, and Atlanta Athletic Club. These courses feature an excellent, if not unrelenting, test of golf skill for the best players in the world. Courses in this category have no non-sense designs that focus on the challenge more than they do creativity or aesthetics. As such the bunkering at Southern Hills is simple saucer shaped hazards, the greens are subtle in their design, and the tree lined fairways provide a distinct visual of where to hit the ball. Historically Southern Hills has few rivals in terms of tournaments hosted or ranking among the various Top 100 lists that are published. If these types of courses and experiences are up your alley then Southern Hills will be among your favorites. That being said, I was expecting more from a course that has so long been revered as one of the finest in the country; however the back nine was admittedly an excellent inward nine that helped boost my opinion of Southern Hills.

What to Expect:  Other than Augusta National, Southern Hills stands alongside Pinehurst as the most historic and revered golf course in the South. With a resume that includes hosting four PGA Championships, three U.S. Opens, and a pair of U.S. Amateur Championships, few courses can claim such a rich history with championship golf. The classic Perry Maxwell design features tree lined fairways, rolling hills, and saucer shaped bunkers. A creek meanders through the property, mainly on the front nine, while a few water hazards come into play on the back nine including at the all-world par four 12th hole. The design epitomizes championship golf by featuring a variety of lengths and shapes of holes that will likely require utilizing every club in your bag throughout the round. Many of the holes with shorter approach shots feature the most challenging greens and thus require more precision with your scoring clubs. The opening hole with views of downtown Tulsa and the uphill 9th hole playing towards the clubhouse are worthy of note to be sure, but the back nine is where Southern Hills truly shines with added character, variety, and enjoyment. Caddies are provided and carts are available during your round. You'll also want to soak in the palatial clubhouse that is stock full of golf history.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  12th Hole – 458 Yard Par 4 – Heralded as one of the finest par fours in the country by Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, and others, the 12th hole at Southern Hills is a great test from tee to green. The tee shot plays to a raised fairway that is framed by trees on both sides before doglegging left. The fairway slopes from right to left towards a creek that runs up the side before cutting across the hole and to the right of the putting surface. The green is additionally protected by a trio of bunkers that start at the front left and work their way in a half-moon shape around to the back side of the putting surface. The approach shot plays over a creek to a slightly domed green that features tightly mown chipping areas around the front left bunker as well as the area leading to the water. It is easily the best hole on the property and one of the finest in the Midwest.

12th Hole at Southern Hills Country Club (458 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  6th Hole – 200 Yards – This is the hole that Angel Cabrera wished he had never encountered during the 2007 PGA Championship. Angel, paired with fellow 2007 major champions Zach Johnson and Padraig Harrington, famously slaughtered this hole in the opening round after hitting his first ball into the bushes, re-teed and hit his next shot out of bounds, re-teed and hit his next ball into the water. Angel then took a drop, hit it on the green, and proceed to 3-putt his way to a 10. In comparison, his playing partners torched the hole by each carding double bogies. The 200 yard par three plays gently downhill over a creek to a green protected by a pair of saucer shaped bunkers and is one of the more attractive holes at Southern Hills.

Best Par 4:  18th Hole – 465 Yards – As is so often the case at major championship courses, the final hole is a strong par four that will test every aspect of your game to close out the round. The dogleg right hole requires a well struck drive the stays between the trees and ideally ends up on the flat spot in the fairway up the left without chasing into the creek that encroaches in prior to the cross bunkers. The inspiring second shot is played uphill towards the sprawling clubhouse that sits at the highest point on the property thus providing an excellent vantage point to the course's final hole. The elevated green is one of the most penal on the course as it can reject shots back towards the surrounding bunkers or down the hill. The stout slope found on the putting surface will make a 2-putt anything but routine from most locations on the green. It was here that Retief Goosen famously missed a two foot putt that would have sealed the 2001 U.S. Open. Fortunately for the South African, he was able to win the title in an 18 hole playoff the next day.

Best Par 5:  13th Hole – 537 Yards – With just two par fives on the property, players should be excited about the opportunity to play this hole that features more character than most any other on the course. A full 120 yards shorter than the lone par five on the front, the 13th hole give players an opportunity to reach this green in two particularly if they challenge the slight dogleg left. A clear view of the target isn't always afforded here so players need to be aware of the two ponds that front the green as well as the circle of bunkers located around the putting surface. Getting above the hole will provide a slick downhill putt that rolls quickly back towards a chipping area squeezed between two of the fronting bunkers. High risk and high reward is the call of the day on the 13th hole which provides the best scoring opportunity the rest of the way at Southern Hills.

Birdie Time:  11th Hole – 173 Yard Par 3 – Southern Hills' shortest hole is also its easiest. Though the green is surrounded by four bunkers, the first par three on the back nine plays shorter than the yardage due to the elevated tee and should put a club in your hand that gives you oodles of confidence to go pin seeking. This hole has been aced more than any other on the course and thus also creates the best chance for you to card a birdie.

11th Hole at Southern Hills Country Club (173 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  2nd Hole – 486 Yard Par 4 – Head Professional Dave Bryan calls this the most demanding driving hole on the golf course due to the 260 yard carry over the cross bunkers and contending with a winding creek that cuts and runs parallel to the fairway. Tipping out just under 500 yards, players are faced with a long approach shot to a green that is slightly elevated above the surrounding bunkers. It is a challenging hole that requires two excellent shots in order to record a par."
49,Shoreacres,"Lake Bluff, IL",Seth Raynor,1921,Routing the Ravines: Shoreacres and Seth Raynor,Andy Johnson,rev49_shoreacres_1,"In the far northern suburbs of Chicago, a Seth Raynor masterpiece lies in the sleepy town of Lake Bluff, Illinois. No golf course is more near and dear to my heart than Shoreacres. Growing up in Lake Bluff, I would occasionally stumble across the opportunity to play or walk Shoreacres. These rounds were the highlight of my summer, from a young age I knew there was something special about Shoreacres. It would take me years to figure what that it factor was. What makes Shoreacres special is its routing, in other words, the manner in which the course is laid out over the ground. It is the foundation of the brilliance of Shoreacres and makes for a beautiful walk, and a fun and varied test of golf.
The routing does have its detractors, specifically those who question Raynor’s decision to bypass putting golf holes on Lake Michigan frontage. It’s a parcel few modern architects would pass on, but Raynor knew the best ground for golf laid inland, away from the water. Like most of Chicago, the ground at Shoreacres is very flat. The site’s greatest asset is the dramatic ravine that winds through the property. Raynor used the ravine in a variety of ways throughout the course to create some of the best holes in the world. On the five holes that don’t interact with the ravines, Raynor wisely placed his boldest greens and design features.
1st hole – par 4 – 480yards

The course opens with a par-5 from the members’ tee and a par-4 from the championship tee. The first plays without the presence of the ravine and over flat ground. Its key feature is a set of two massive cross bunkers which split the fairway. This Great Hazard feature was often used by A.W. Tillinghast and puts pressure on players to hit a good tee shot to clear the bunker with their second shot. The 1st green is among the most challenging at Shoreacres. It’s pushed up and guarded by a bunker on the left side. The green has a false front and falls away on the right and back side. The green subtlety moves from front to back making a pitch shots from short of the green sneaky fast.
2nd hole – par 4 – 358 yards

The second presents golfers with their first encounter with the ravine that plays a role on 13 of Shoreacres 18 holes. At the second it cuts across the front of the fairway on a diagonal and runs up the left side of the hole. The second is Shoreacres’ Cape template and presents a number of different strategic choices. Aggressive play can yield a short pitch shot into the green but carries the risk of finding the creek and ravine up the left. A safe play is a long-iron up the right side, but it leaves a short iron approach from a poor angle into a green that slopes right to left. A subtle aspect of the second is the orientation of the green. It is slightly angled to the left, giving an advantage to the player who is aggressive and finds the left side from the tee. The approach shot has to deal with the creek which wraps around the green and makes a player think twice before flag hunting. The second gives players a glimpse of what’s to come and is one of America’s finest renditions of the Cape Hole.
3rd hole – par 4 – 312 yards

The 3rd hole moves up a small rise in the property and is one of the five holes devoid of the ravine on property. The short par-4 is an example of the Leven template. Much like the first, without a ravine, Raynor ramped up the design features, with a giant forebunker, a fronting mound, and a remarkable green. The green slopes severely from back to front and has a front and back tier. In the middle of the putting surface there is a knob which diverts shots back down to the front if they aren’t struck with the perfect touch. The third begs long players to go for it from the tee, but will leave a pitch shot that feels as awkward as a breakup call.
4th hole – par 4 – 393 yards

The ravine returns on the breathtaking 4th hole cutting across the front of the fairway and this time running up the right side. Sheridan Road and out of bounds runs up the left making the 4th one of the more demanding tee shots on property. The fairway has a swale 300 yards from the tee which can lead to some uneven lies. The green is masterful. It slopes from back to front and has a small thumbprint in the center which makes for difficult long putts.
5th hole – par 4 – 491 yards

The 5th is one of the most difficult par-4s in Chicago. The tee shot is demanding with another helping of out of bounds down the left side and trees to the right. Missing the fairway almost guarantees a layup short of the ravine which cuts across the center of the 5th. A tee shot up the left side provides the best angle to approach the green with a mid to long iron, but brings in the most risk. The green features a false front and a back tier. Par is always a great score at the 5th.
6th hole – par 3 – 214 yards

The 6th is situated on another flat and ravineless part of the property. Again, Raynor employed a bold feature to fill the void. The 6th is Shoreacres’ Biarritz hole, a massive green complex that features a 60 yard long green that’s bisected by a six foot deep swale. The green depth allows the hole to play anywhere from 170 to 230, and orients due east with a cool lake breeze often making it even longer.
7th hole – par 4 – 487 yards

The long par-4 7th tees off over the ravine which runs up the right side. The fairway is abundantly wide and allows a tactical player to set up an angle for their long-iron approach. The 7th is Shoreacres’ Double Plateau green, with its three distinct sections. The front right is the most accessible and sits at ground level. The back right is the smallest section and guarded by bunkers on either side. The most difficult pin to access is the front left pin – it’s guarded by a deep bunker and sits on a plateau. To get a long iron close a player must play up the right side of the fairway.
8th hole – par 3 – 196 yards

Shoreacres turns back east for the par-3 8th, their version of the Eden Hole. Today, the 8th plays over a pond but originally it was the ravine. The pond was damned for irrigation purposes in the ‘60s. For aesthetic continuity, it would be tremendous to see the ravine restored one day. The mid-length par three presents an intimidating shot to the perched and severe green which slopes from back to front and has a subtle false front to repel balls down the apron and into the rough.
9th hole – par 4 – 388 yards

The 9th continues east and away from the ravine. It shares a fairway and dramatic bunkering with the neighboring 18th. There is abundant room to the right to miss but it leaves a longer approach shot from a disadvantaged angle. The ninth is often overlooked but its green evokes discomfort and can sneak up on players.
10th hole – par 4 – 467 yards

The round turns and heads back out to the ravine-scape for the back nine. Kicking things off is perhaps America’s finest rendition of the Road Hole. This brawny par-4 asks players to bite off as much as they can chew from the tee. The primary hazard is a ravine that cuts diagonally up the right side. A daring player who takes on the ravine is rewarded with the ideal angle into the difficult green complex. The green has a severe false front and a deep front left bunker guarding approach shots. It is quite shallow, leading to over-aggressive players finding the back bunker. The 10th is one of the finest holes in America.
11th hole – par 4 – 371 yards

After the 10th, Raynor hits his crescendo in the routing with the jaw-dropping 11th. Critics of Raynor often claim “a lack of creativity and over-dependence on templates.” The stretch of 11-15 is Raynor’s counterpoint to those critics. The 11th is what I would call a “found golf hole”. The great ravine which stretches across the property traverses in front of the tee, down the right side and back in front of the green. It’s as dramatic of an inland hole that exists in golf. It calls for a long-iron or fairway wood off the tee. The ravine cuts out and back in, making the right side far more narrow than it appears from the tee. The short-iron approach is forced to carry the ravine onto a green with a big false front that slopes from right to left. If the 11th doesn’t get your juices flowing, I would suggest finding another hobby.
12th hole – par 3 – 136 yards

The routing moves on to the most photographed hole at Shoreacres, the Short par-3 12th which plays down into the ravine. Further illustrating the variety of the routing, on the 8th, Raynor asked players to play over the ravine, now they play into. The downhill shot and trees make it difficult to judge the wind and distance into the terrifying green. The false front is quick to send shots inches short of perfection back into the bunker. Any approach that’s slightly past the pin faces a slippery putt and missing pin high will leave a swinging birdie putt. Nothing good happens to those who miss long. The 12th is as equally maddening to players as it is beautiful.
13th hole – par 4 – 323 yards

Many architects would have avoided going back into this corner of the property for fear of not being able to get out. Not so with Raynor. His routing is at full octane on the short par-4 13th where players hit out of the ravine. The blind tee shot calls for a long-iron and will leave a short-iron or wedge approach shot. The ravine runs up the left side of the hole and again cuts across the front of the green forcing players to hit over it on their approach. Finding the fairway is a must at the 13th because of the vexing green complex. The 13th has the most severe false front that takes up the front quarter of the green. The approach shot tests players’ distance and spin control. Shots too strong find a back trench bunker and shots a few feet too short will be rejected by the front.
14th hole – par 3 – 216 yards

The par-3 14th plays parallel to the 6th and is Shoreacres Redan Hole. The ravine cuts in front and along the left side, very much in play for a player who overcooks a draw. The green slopes hard right to left and front to back. An ideal shot will find the front right of the green and feed back to the pin but comes with the risk of a miss long (dead) or short (awkward).
15th hole – par 5 – 529 yards

The fifteenth is the final hole on the most dramatic piece of the property and is one of the finest par-5s in all of golf. The tee shot tests a player’s appetite for risk. The par five doglegs around the ravine on the left side, giving those who take it up the left a far shorter approach for their second. The ravine then cuts across the fairway setting up a heroic carry for the second shot. The fairway on the other side of the ravine is split into a right and left side by a series of centerline bunkers. Carrying the bunkers earns a player the reward of a downslope which will propel shots onto one of the course’s largest greens. The putting surface slopes from back to front and has a prominent back tier and difficult pin positions.
16th hole – par 4 – 463 yards

The 16th is Shoreacres final difficult par-4, with the ravine running in front of the fairway and up the right side. The landing area for tee shots is generous, but is followed by the challenge of a long second shot into the difficult and well-guarded green. Flanked by bunkers on the right and left, the small 16th green is perched and slopes from back to front. It’s welcoming to a run up shot but any miss will make for a tough up-and-down.
17th hole – par 4 – 347 yards

The 17th turns back and signals the start of the jaunt towards the clubhouse. The short par-4 provides a number of options from the tee. The ravine again cuts in front and up the left of the hole, turning into the manmade lake that fronts the 8th. The 17th fairway sits on a slight angle that makes it play narrower the further a player advances their tee shot. A safe play is to layup to a good number in the 100-150 yard range. A long hitter could drive the green in the right conditions but faces the dangers of native grass right and the course’s deepest bunker on the left. The green is the star of the 17th. Heavily guarded by bunkers, the front section is narrow and makes for a difficult approach. The back portion has a right and left half – over the bunker left has some punchbowl tendencies while the back right offers a small shelf.
18th hole – par 4 – 558 yards

The home hole is Shoreacres’ longest par-5 and is littered with strategic bunkering tee to green. The fairway pinches for long hitters thanks to a deep and bold bunker. A long player can reach the green in two but a miss in the wrong spot makes for a difficult par. The 18th green is one of the best on the course. For pins on the right, it’s wise to set up the third with a shot up the left side. Conversely, for a right pin, a layup of the right is preferred."
50,Shoreacres,"Lake Bluff, IL",Seth Raynor,1921,Shoreacres,top100golfcourses,rev50_shoreacres_2,"Shoreacres is located on Chicago’s north shore. Seth Raynor, who built Camargo around the same time before going on to design Yale and Fishers Island, constructed Shoreacres in 1919. Tom Doak's Renaissance Design was involved in course restoration work in 1993, increasing green sizes amongst other modifications.

When you arrive at Shoreacres, you can almost feel a throwback in time to the 1920s as you approach the David Alder clubhouse. The course is unique and challenging with several ravines and creeks that come into play. With narrow tree-lined fairways and large, fast greens which are heavily bunkered, accuracy at Shoreacres is more important than length.

The acclaimed stretch from the 10th to 15th holes is regarded as Raynor’s finest. It begins with a 452-yard version of the Road Hole (complete with out of bounds to the right) and ends with the scenic 521-yard Shoreacres signature hole which requires a bold tee shot which must carry a ravine to have any chance of reaching this par five in two shots. Even then, finding the green isn’t straightforward. Bunkers guard the right and left side of this back to front sloping green. The 15th is not the toughest hole on the course but it’s a supremely strategic example of a short par five.

Darius Oliver, in this short extract from the book Planet Golf USA, writes: “Aside from some terrific individual holes, what makes Shoreacres such an interesting course is its evenness and Raynor’s clever use of the topography. His greens and bunkers are well positioned and the fairways flow with enough variety to keep players on their guard. This layout is a little short for today’s star golfer, but for the average guy able to look beyond length and slop ratings this is one of Chicago’s premier places to play.”"
51,Somerset Hills,"Bernardsville, NJ",A.W. Tillinghast,1918,Somerset Hills,top100golfcourses,rev51_somerset_hills_1,"Somerset Hills Country Club is an A.W. Tillinghast creation and it’s naturally natural with nothing brash or ostentatious about the course. With glorious green sites and a pretty layout, it’s a course that’s waiting to steal your affections. But first of all you’ll need to befriend a kindly member because Somerset Hills is yet another of America’s prestigious private clubs.

Located in Bernardsville, New Jersey, Somerset Hills is perhaps one of Tilly’s finest creations and it’s a jewel that fits the contrasting land like a silk glove, where there's plenty of variation to keep everyone happy (length of holes and green sites), Somerset Hills is an unusual layout that flows cleverly around the flat, open, links-like terrain of a former racetrack for the outward nine and across hilly, dense woodland for the homeward half.

Author Darius Oliver wrote in his book Planet Golf USA: “Somerset Hills Country Club has diligently preserved this great track and they deserve great credit for resisting the urge to modify holes or soften their marvelous green shapes.

At various times they have had issues with tree growth and the loss of playing areas, but in recent years a carefully supervised restoration program has successfully returned much of the layout to the original Tillinghast plan.

What’s cool about the course are not the things that Tillinghast experimented with here and then took on later projects, but the unique design features that he rarely tried anywhere else.”

Perhaps the pick of the holes is the par four 15th which is flanked by trees creating intimacy. The fairway slides downhill and then doglegs to the right to reveal perhaps the largest green on the Jekyll and Hyde course that is Somerset Hills.

The Bernardsville layout has been revised down the years as follows: William Gordon (1946); Hal Purdy (1956 and 1968); Tom Doak (2010 and 2013) with consultant Brian Slawnik of Renaissance Golf Design. In 2017 Brian suggested altering the par five 10th to a short par four, allowing holes 11 and 18 to be lengthened."
52,Somerset Hills,"Bernardsville, NJ",A.W. Tillinghast,1918,"Somerset Hills Country Club (Bernardsville, New Jersey)",Bill Satterfield,rev52_somerset_hills_2,"Somerset Hills is an A.W. Tillinghast design that many critics have crowned as his best work in regards to the greens. From the false front Bunker Hill green, to the alps-like Dolomites green, and to the classic Redan green, Somerset Hills is a fun test with the flat stick. The hillier and water filled back nine is quite different from the tamer and more open front nine. Like many Tillinghast courses, the par 5s are nothing to write home about. However, the collection of par threes are nothing short of stellar and several of the two-shotters are holes you won't soon forget and will want to play again and again. The locker room is intimate and the atomosphere is classy but not stuffy at the clubhouse and restaurant. Fantastic views are had from the balcony where you can sip down a beverage and enjoy the evening.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  11th Hole – 412 Yard Par 4 – (Perfection) - Perfection is a good adjective for this downhill dogleg right hole. Water is featured along the left side of the second half of the hole and will drown a tee shot that is played too long off the tee. The approach shot is played across a creek to a undulated green that will only reward the best of strokes. It is a gorgeous inland hole and the start of a special stretch of holes on the back nine.

11th Hole at Somerset Hills Country Club (412 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 3:  2nd Hole – 175 Yards – (Redan) - While the setting of this Redan hole is not near as impressive as National Golf Links, Shinnecock, or Yale, the terrain at this site was a perfect fit. Taking dead aim at a pin position anywhere other than the front right portion of the green is a risky proposition and should only be executed when you are ""in the zone."" The slope off to the left side of the green is the most severe of any Redan we've played to date.

2nd Hole at Somerset Hills Country Club (175 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  15th Hole – 407 Yards – (Happy Valley) - From the tee this hole doesn't appear to be anything special, but after hitting your tee shot up the hill and following the dogleg right you are faced with a beautiful view to a green that is front by a stone lined creek. A big drive with a fade can catch the downslope and run quite toward the green while a miscue with the driver will likely lead to a layup shot. The downhill approach shot is exhilarating and rewarding when executed properly. From tee to green, this is the best hole at Somerset Hills.

15th Hole at Somerset Hills Country Club (407 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  6th Hole – 501 Yards – (Plateau) - The evidence of the old horse race track comes into view on the 6th hole. This dogleg right measures just three feet over 500 yards and is thus very reachable in two strokes. The mounding and bunkering around the green coupled with the heavily treed backdrop make a nice framework to this green site.

6th Hole at Somerset Hills Country Club (501 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  12th Hole – 151 Yard Par 3 – (Despair) - Even though there is water the entire left side of this hole, the short par three 12th delivers an excellent chance to score a birdie. A low iron or wedge will be in your hand and you will have a perfect lie and be hitting to a fairly tame green; all good elements for making a two.

12th Hole at Somerset Hills Country Club (151 Yard Par 3)
Bogey Beware:  3rd Hole – 378 Yard Par 4 – (Bunker Hill) - The scorecard rates this hole as the 11th handicap, but whenever you are faced with a severe uphill tee shot to a green that will literally send balls 40 yards back down the fairway then you have a challenge on your hands. If the pin is back then the previous hole, Dolomites, might be bogey time since it features one of the craziest greens I've ever seen with a series of severe hills designed into it. However, if the pin is in the front on #3 (like the photo below), there is a good chance you will leave your approach short and watch it cascade back down the fairway; or you may just three putt from the back of the green since fear should reside in your soul as you tentatively approach the hole but fear going beyond it and back down the hill."
53,California Golf Club of San Francisco,"South San Francisco, CA","A.V. Macan, 1926/Alister MacKenzie, 1928/Kyle Phillips, 2007",1926,California Golf Club of San Francisco,,rev53_california_gc_sf_1,"The California Golf Club of San Francisco dates back to the Golden Age of design and, although the club can trace its roots back to 1918, California Golf Club did not truly come of age until it moved to its present site in the mid 1920s.

The club originally commissioned little known Scotsman Willie Lock to design the course on the new site in the fashionable Bay Area, but an Irishman, Arthur Vernon Macan, replaced him before construction started. It’s unclear as to why Locke was replaced by Macan but we do know that Locke routed California, so he should receive posthumous credit. Alister MacKenzie was drafted in to address shortfalls in California’s bunkering in 1927 and since then the club’s reputation soared.
Former Walker Cup player Gene Andrews won the US Senior Men's Amateur Championship here at the California Golf Club of San Francisco in 1970, which was probably the club’s proudest moment.

In 2005, after years of struggling with putting surfaces infested with roundworms, the club decided to rebuild the greens and Kyle Phillips was the chosen architect following a dramatic proposal. Not only did Phillips rebuild the greens, he also built five new holes so that the club could boast a stronger outward nine to complement the existing excellent homeward nine.

According to his official website “Kyle Phillips Golf Course Design renovated and restored the course using 1927 as a benchmark when Dr Alister MacKenzie re-bunkered the course. The original course, designed by A. Vernon Macan, had been compromised in the 1960s when San Bruno Creek gave way to the existing Westborough Road, leaving only 13 of the original holes intact… The first event at the newly renovated course was highlighted with a 6-hole exhibition by PGA Tour player Arron Oberholser and former U.S. Open Champion Ken Venturi hitting the ceremonial first ball.”

The California Golf Club of San Francisco can now boast tournament measurements. From the new back tees, which are aptly called Venturi, the course can be stretched to more than 7,200 yards.

The following edited extract by George Waters is from Volume Six of Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective. 

“The California Club of San Francisco completed work a few years ago that nicely illustrates the value of component restoration. Before the project, the course was a scramble of different designs. The original routing had been substantially altered by land sales and highway projects. Some very interesting holes playing along a creek had been lost for ever.

Although Alister MacKenzie had performed a complete redesign of the course’s bunkering early in the club’s history, years of wear and tear, tinkering and redesign had stolen nearly all of the character from his work. Newly constructed ponds and other impromptu features further detracted from what is arguably the best golfing ground held by any of the courses in San Francisco.

Kyle Phillips, the entrusted architect, approached the two nines differently. The routing of the back nine was more or less intact, and there was a reasonable amount of photographic evidence regarding MacKenzie’s bunkering. Phillips worked very closely with the original holes on the back nine, deviating only slightly from a full restoration.

The front nine was a different story. This was where large parts of the original course had been lost and where photographic record was limited. Philips had to devise some creative solutions to these holes to get the most out of the property. By relocating the practice area away from the clubhouse he was able to make use of some exciting terrain that was previously unused.

He also engaged in large-scale earthwork to recreate the feel and playing characteristics of the lost creekside holes. At the same time, Phillips kept the bunkering style consistent and chose to restore selected elements. This kept the front nine consistent with the back nine; additionally, it connected the history of the course. The result is a design that uses the property to the best advantage, while making a strong connection with the past. The ‘Cal Club’ represents a highly successful component restoration.”"
54,California Golf Club of San Francisco,"South San Francisco, CA","A.V. Macan, 1926/Alister MacKenzie, 1928/Kyle Phillips, 2007",1926,"The California Golf Club Of San Francisco (South San Francisco, California)",Bill Satterfield,rev54_california_gc_sf_2,"There is a contentious debate among golfers, and certainly among members, of which private course in San Francisco is the best. While some contend it is the Lake course at Olympic Club with its shot shaping and history of hosting U.S. Opens, and others argue that it is San Francisco Golf Club with its old school charm and intimate routing, I am firmly in the camp that The California Golf Club is comfortably the best course in the Bay Area. The movement in the terrain, and the way the holes are designed within it, represent some of the best work I’ve seen. A masterful variety of uphill and downhill shots are required while also rewarding players that can shape their ball when needed; though the fairways offer plenty of width to navigate within. The tees and fairways feature fescue grass which plays firm and fast while the bentgrass greens roll pure and with pace. The renovation that Kyle Phillips did was masterful and features some of the most attractive bunkering you will find at any course in the world, especially with how the edging compliments the shape of the Monterey tree tops. The afternoons at Cal Club are notoriously windy and temperatures rarely get very warm so having a jacket or sweater handy is recommended while pants are mandatory. You’ll also have a caddie to help carry your clubs and navigate the course since walking is required the majority of the time. In the end, Cal Club has few peers when it comes to exceptional variety in terrain, hole shapes, and overall design; it is simply one of the best inland courses in the world.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  16th Hole – 133 Yard Par 3 – An under-utilized design feature in a routing but found at great courses such as Sand Hills and Cypress Point, a short par three late in the round is revealed as the 16th hole at The Cal Club. Like the 12th at Augusta National, winds swirl here and create havoc with club selection, especially since you'll be hitting a club that will launch high in the air and receive maximum exposure to the gusts. The kidney-shaped green is twice as wide as it is deep and is encircled by seven bunkers that protect every edge except the front left portion of the putting surface. The biggest mistake you can make here is to have a lack of commitment, so despite whatever conditions you have no control over, commit to the club and swing that will give you the best opportunity to stick the green. 5s are as common as 2s here, but at just 133 yards and playing downhill, it is gettable by every range of handicap.

16th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (133 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 3:  12th Hole – 232 Yards – I fell in love with this hole the moment I laid eyes on it. A beautiful setup with the green perched on a high spot with a valley fronting it and a series of tee boxes working their way up the opposite hillside is unveiled at the 12th while the towering Monterey pines on each side frame in the setting. The tee shot threads the 11th and 18th greens enroute to a putting surface that is protected by seven bunkers; most of which are found on the left side of the hole. A front right pin is the most accessible while back left takes some serious game to hit a tee shot close to. I love par threes that play a bit uphill while still offering a glimpse of the putting surface, and this one is top shelf.

12th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (232 Yard Par 3)
Best Par 4:  7th Hole – 411 Yards – There are so many good two-shotters at The Cal Club that it is a shame to feature just one, but the 7th certainly stands out as the most dramatic and memorable. Found on the western side of the property, the 7th runs along a ridge that features tons of falloff on each side of the fairway and the right side being the most prevalent in view as the fairway capes around it. Balls that don't find the short grass will likely go MIA for the rest of your round so it is imperative you keep your tee ball in play. Carrying the bunker complex on the corner will require 255 yards of carry which doesn't seem that difficult, but with the prevailing wind coming in from the west it is quick to knock down tee shots since they will be traveling west north west towards their destination. The fairway tilts left to right and tumbles downhill towards the green requiring players to play their approach shot short and let their ball trundle onto the putting surface. With the mountain of South San Francisco creating the backdrop and the ravines creating a sense of isolation, the setting for the 7th is fantastic.

7th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (411 Yard Par 4)
Best Par 5:  17th Hole – 567 Yards – The words ""South San Francisco The Industrial City"" painted on the mountain in the backdrop creates an ideal aiming point on the 17th hole, though going up the left side of the fairway can be beneficial considering the left-to-right tilt the fairway features. The bunkers on the right side are easily carried but leaking a tee shot to the right of them will get into the trees or potentially work its way out of bounds, so the miss here is definitely to the left. After ascending uphill with the tee shot, players crest the hill and find the fairway switches to a right-to-left tilt and steadily descends 50 feet enroute to the green that is littered with bunkers on each side. The ideal approach shot carries the bunker complex that is 50 yards short of the green on the left side and then catches the slope that will send balls bounding to the right towards the putting surface. The good shots here can get you home in two, and even if you are a little short, there is a good opportunity to wedge a shot close and walk away with a birdie before heading to the finishing hole.

17th Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (567 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  1st Hole – 535 Yard Par 5 – The opening hole is as generous as Cal Club is going to get with this downhill par five to start off with. The fairway tumbles downhill from tee to the green which makes this hole it very reachable in two; particularly with the firm conditions. 280 yards up the left side is a fairway bunker that you'll want to avoid but stands as a nice aiming point to hit a little cut off of. The front of the green is receptive with just a bunker pinching in from the right to be aware of, but an aerial or ground shot here should find the green. In fact, you'll want to play a shot that lands short of the front edge since balls will kick forward onto the putting surface. There are plenty of challenging holes at Cal Club to contend with, so go get yourself a birdie here and build up some insurance early.

1st Hole at The California Golf Club of San Francisco (535 Yard Par 5)
Bogey Beware:  3rd Hole – 437 Yard Par 4 – Dubbed by many as the signature hole at Cal Club, the 3rd is a strong par four that bends to the right around some tall pines and difficult bunkering. It is tempting to challenge the corner, but with over 300 yards to carry the sand and trees that swat down shots more often than seeing balls sail over them, the prudent play is up the left half of the fairway. However, the further left you go the more the greenside bunkering comes into play that laces the left side of the putting surface. The circular green is less than 5,000 sq.ft. and doesn't provide a large target if approaching the green from mid-iron length. The downhill nature of the tee shot puts a premium on accuracy and the tightness of the ideal landing spots amps things up even more, so you'll need to be on your best game to find a green in regulation here."
55,Garden City,"Garden City, NY","Devereux Emmet, 1899/Walter Travis, 1906",1899,GARDEN CITY GOLF CLUB - 16 POINTS,David Jones,rev55_garden_city_1,"We were warned before arriving at Garden City Golf course that it was a little, well, eccentric. The place has a reputation for being a relic of a bygone age – where ‘men were men’ and women were neither seen nor heard. The reputation is fully deserved.

There is a sign welcoming you to the club making it clear that jackets must be warn at all times. Actually, that only applies to the inside lounge and dining areas. You can eat on the terrace outside sans jacket without fear of being kicked off of the premises.

For sure this place has some quirks. The locker room is the closest thing I have seen to a school changing room for over 25 years, in fact I imagine there are few school changing rooms in the Western hemisphere as antiquated as this. There are only 399 members at the club – apparently if they got to 400 members they would have to start allowing women some rights of access which the members aren’t ready for just yet.
Garden City Golf Course
So yes, there are some odd things going on but the people we met were all very friendly and charming and didn’t seem to mind my pink shorts one bit!

So, to the course. This had hidden gem written all over it before we played. The course is built on sandy land, but not a links. I had been led to expect something more akin to one of England’s heath courses. As always the Golf Club Atlas site was a great source of background reading with this write-up here - http://golfclubatlas.com/courses-by-country/usa/garden-city/.  You will read there how the course was crafted by Devereux Emmet and significantly developed by Walter Travis following the 1902 US Open. 

And so, it was with a real sense of expectation we wondered onto the first tee – a 300 yard par 4.  A perfect yardage for my first hole! We had a couple of perfectly good caddies – mine was an Irish guy who worked hard to endear himself all the way round – who assured us we were in for something quite special.

And, I’m afraid it didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Maybe it was that we came to Garden City having played some of the real top drawer courses in the area and were too blinded by what we had seen but it just felt a bit, well, OK. The course was very playable – open and everything was in front of you at all times. It is said by some to be a triumph of minimalism, actually we found it a little featureless.  Sure the bunkering was interesting (many of which were upturned which was an unusual addition) and there was a lot of strategy involved with putting together a good score I’m sure, but the course never really got the juices flowing.
Garden City Golf
Don’t get me wrong there was much to enjoy – there’s a nice gentle opening par 4 followed by a lovely short par 3 over a quarry. The course then heads out through a very pleasant few holes which will use plenty of the clubs in your bag. Tom Doak did a lot of work on the course a few years ago and without a doubt there is plenty to keep you interested – especially around the greens. Looking back on my round here I can’t really remember that many of the holes clearly – not a great sign. The finish was again an interesting one – the par 5 17th yielded an eagle from our group before the knee-knocking finishing hole.  A mid length par 3 over water. I managed a big hook to the first tee which made for an unusual angle for my second!

After the round we enjoyed a tour of the clubhouse.  As you would expect for a place that hosted a US Open, 4 US Amateurs and a Walker Cup all before 1936 was out there is much to see.  The club historian was there and did a great job at telling us some of the stories from the past - you really felt that you were stepping back in time.

This was a hard course to score. If you were a real architectural nut who was there to appreciate every nuance of the ground maybe you would appreciate it more. For me, I just couldn’t fathom how this had a place in the top 100 in the world. One of my playing partners showed his Neanderthal qualities in the extreme by suggesting quite volubly on the drive back to Manhattan when he suggested it wasn’t much better than a local council course in the UK.

That was harsh for sure. However, it is probably a course to go in with you expectations low and prepare to be surprised and delighted rather than think it will be the highlight of your golfing life!

BOOKING THE COURSE
The clubhouse at Garden City is well worth a look around to enjoy artefacts from a bygone era!
The clubhouse at Garden City is well worth a look around to enjoy artefacts from a bygone era!

Well, there are 399 members and one of them has to invite you as far as I can see, therefore this isn’t the easiest tee time in the world to snag.. There are some high end travel agencies who claim they can get you onto ‘bucket list’ experiences so maybe give one of them a try but if truth be told I wouldn’t pay too much for the honour.

TOUR TIPS

Garden City is very doable from Manhattan – time depending you can drive it within an hour – and is a good stop-off on the way to the Hamptons. That’s about all I have to say I’m afraid as we came in and out quite quickly! June and September may be the best months to play – out of the cold winter months and away from the oppressive summer heat and storms."
56,Garden City,"Garden City, NY","Devereux Emmet, 1899/Walter Travis, 1906",1899,Garden City Golf Club,top100golfcourses,rev56_garden_city_2,"Garden City Golf Club is very different to most courses that are regularly ranked in the World Top 100. The strict men-only policy of this exclusive club puts it in the limelight for all the wrong reasons.

In 1897, when the course first opened for play on the Hempstead Plain in Long Island Village, it was in the middle of rural countryside. Today, Garden City Golf Club is an oasis in the middle of suburban sprawl.
Devereux Emmet originally designed the course in 1896. In 1902, the 9th US Open was staged here – Laurie Auchterlonie was the eventual winner. Walter Travis made some modifications to the course in the Roaring Twenties and he can probably claim to have turned Garden City into the fascinating layout that it is today.

The ground is ostensibly light loam so many people classify Garden City as an inland links or a heathland course. Classifying Garden City as either a links or heathland course would be wrong, even though it does possess many of their characteristics.

Garden City is a course for the minimalists, so it's just as well Tom Doak completed a restoration programme here in 2015. There’s nothing bold or brash about Garden City it’s just a simple, natural course which does everything in a reassured but understated way.

In the book Planet Golf USA, author Darius Oliver writes: “The topography at Garden City isn’t overly dramatic, but the course is beautifully routed and the designers did a superb job squeezing quality holes out of fairly unremarkable landforms. With plenty of half-par holes and hazards arranged to create genuine risk/reward dilemma, Garden City is particularly well suited to matchplay… Steeped in the traditions of early American golf, Garden City is an unpretentious treasure that continues to excite and delight.”"
57,Maidstone,"East Hampton, NY",John Park/Willie Park Jr.,1922,Maidstone Club: An Unforgettable Experience,Sean Ogle,rev57_maidstone_1,"As I sit here and write this, it has been nearly as year since I did a proper course writeup.

When I first began this site I was extremely diligent in writing about every top course I played (and even many not-so-top courses).

The reality is, between the writing, photo editing, and promotion – each post takes a lot of time to put together, and frankly as much as I love golf, I have a business to run as well.


However as April has turned into May, the weather begins to turn and I just received my copy of “How to Play the World’s Most Exclusive Golf Clubs” I’ve found myself getting back into golf mode.

In the next month I have rounds lined up at Garden City, Merion, Philly Cricket Club, Aronimink and possibly a few others that let’s just say, have me really looking forward to the summer golfing season.

Now, because of my lack of writing (and photo editing for that matter), I’m left with nearly two dozen top 100 courses that I’ve played – but have yet to do a proper write up on.

So as I was thinking back about where to start, there was one obvious choice that sticks out as one of the most enjoyable rounds I’ve played on my quest: Maidstone Club.

My First Trip to the Hamptons

Early last spring I received an email through this blog that said simply:

“Sean, I’d love to extend an invitation to play Maidstone and maybe the National if you’re ever out on Long Island.”

As you can imagine, my response was pretty much “I will fly to Long Island, at any time, on any day, under whatever terms you desire, if we can make this work.”

Ok, that’s not quite what I said, but I essentially said I’d be happy to plan a trip around it.

A few months later, I’d planned my New York trip – and up until the week before I wasn’t totally sure if it would happen or not.

However the day finally came, and in one of those “I hope I don’t get murdered scenarios” – my host picked me up in Manhattan around 10pm after he got done working, and we made the 2.5 hour drive to East Hampton together – having never shared more than a couple lines of text back and forth in emails.

The plan was to stay at his mom’s house in East Hampton, play in the morning and then I was going to take a bus back later that evening.


Well, the one thing he forgot to mention was that his mom’s “house” was a palatial estate less than two minutes from the club.

It truly was one of those “how did I end up here?” moments, and was a fitting introduction to “the Hamptons” which I’d always heard so much about.

As I was getting ready to head to sleep that night, I knew it would be a warm day ahead, so I asked my host if shorts were ok to wear.

His response:

“Shorts are fine, but would you mind shaving?”

My unshaven “homeless chic” look probably wasn’t going to illicit the best first impression to the club and his fellow members.

He had to let me borrow a razor.

Maidstone First Impressions

We woke up the next morning and headed to the course. We had to be done by noon as there was a members event, so we were getting an early start.

The day was absolutely perfect. 

A light breeze, not a cloud in the sky, and I was literally giddy.

This was one of my first true experiences with a “fortress club” or an extremely private club where they usually don’t allow people like me in – so I was going to savor every second.

We spent some time on the range and practiced our short game before heading to the first tee – which truly had a magical feel.

The ocean is directly behind the tee, and you’re teeing off into a place very few people have the privilege of seeing.


We would be playing with Dave and David, two other guests of the club. Both of whom I’ve kept in touch with, and the latter of which hosted me for what would be my most enjoyable round of 2016 up to this point, down at his club near Miami.

The Course

Unlike some of it’s other Long Island brethren like Shinnecock or Bethpage Black – Maidstone is not known for being a ball-busting course.

In fact from the tips it measures just over 6600 yards, so hardly menacing in length by anyone’s standards.

I didn’t know a whole lot about the course itself before teeing off. What I did know however was that it had a reputation for having a weak start, a weak finish, and some world class holes in between.

Did I agree? Let’s find out.

Hole 1 (Par 4, 424 Yards)

As I mentioned, the opening tee shot at Maidstone is one of the few I’ve had lately where I legitimately had butterflies. I was excited, and there were a number of other members waiting to tee off behind me, so I was just doing everything in my power not to embarrass myself.

I found the first hole to be the perfect opener.

You had a big wide open fairway on your tee shot, so as long as you stayed out of the fairway bunker on the right, you’re in good shape.

Also, the approach to the plateau green made you think, but it wasn’t anything too scary.

My perfect kind of opening hole.

You can also immediately see the work that had been done by Coore-Crenshaw, with some of their signature blown out bunkering that would become a theme for the rest of the course.

Maidstone Hole 1

 

Hole 2 (Par 5, 537 yards)

The second was a mid-length par 5 with bunkers to be aware of on both sides of the fairway. Accuracy is demanded, but electing to hit 3 wood brings the rather large bunker on the right into play.



Maidstone Hole 2

Hole 3 (Par 4, 408 yards)

We get our first bit of elevation change on the 3rd, which is a mid-length par 4.

The tee shot is relatively benign as long as you aren’t too far left or right, but the approach is surrounded by bunkers to an undulating green.

Maidstone Hole 3


Hole 4 (Par 3, 250ish from new tees)

This is where I feel things really start stepping up.

What used to be a fairly simple par 3, has apparently recently received some steroids injected into it.

On the card, this hole plays 176 from the back tees.

Well apparently the cards hadn’t been updated, because we got to play it from the new tees which stood at a stout 251 yards out. Yes, for a “short” course, that’s a serious par 3. Especially because anything short is looking at bunkers or lake.

Maidstone Hole 4 Small



Hole 5 (Par 4, 325 yards)

Ah, my favorite type of hole – the short par 4!

And this is about as good as they come in my book.

From the tips its a solid poke at 325, but depending on which tees your playing and what the wind is doing this could be reachable.

This is a really strategic hole.

Do you hit driver and risk a slice or hook into the wetlands or water? Or bombing it over the green into the water?

Do you back off and go hybrid or three wood, which brings the bottle neck of bunkers into play just short of the green?

Or do you play smart and hit an iron into the middle of the fairway.

There’s no right or wrong answer, but just be willing to live with the choices you make 🙂

Oh, and try not to be distracted by the houses in the background that cost more than you’ll make in a lifetime…

Maidstone Hole 5



Hole 6 (Par 4, 403 yards)

6 and 7 are back to back cape holes (with 6 being a bit of a psuedo-cape design).

You tee off to a diagonal fairway over marsh land, and the farther right you go, the longer the carry (but shorter the approach).

Too far left and you’re in the bunkers, or way too far left and you’re into the marsh.

The green slopes strongly left to right, and will be a challenge regardless of where the pin is. One of my favorite greens on the course.

The approach on 6.
The approach on 6.

Hole 7 (Par 4, 341 yards)

Seven is a proper cape hole over water. Bite off as much as you want.

I watched a big banana slice go into the water, before playing it a bit safer on my second shot.

But a well struck ball to the left side of the fairway should leave you with an easy approach.

Maidstone Hole 7

Hole 8 (Par 3, 151 yards)

The 8th at Maidstone is one of the most unique holes on the course. From the teebox, only the left side of the green is visible, so depending on where the pin is that day, you could be facing a blind tee shot.



It’s also a phenomenal example of a course that seamlessly blends into the landscape. The bunkers look like a natural extension of the dunes.

Maidstone Hole 8

Hole 9 (Par 4, 415 yards)

Walking up onto the all-world 9th hole, you know you’re some place special.

You get your first full glimpse of the ocean, and you’re treated to a beautiful par 4 that takes you down into the dunes, and then right back up again on the approach.

From the tee you have a fantastic view of the course and dunes, and it’s one of those spots where you truly should take a minute and soak it all in. Golf simply doesn’t get much better than this.

The fore bunker that crosses the fairway can throw off your perception, so trust your distance and don’t under club – or risk rolling into one of the scarier bunkers on the course.

Maidstone Hole 9 2Maidstone hole 9 Approach


Hole 10 (Par 4, 401 yards)

The right bunker is in play off the tee as you hit it over the tall grass. From there you’re left with an approach to a large green with trouble on either side.

Maidstone Hole 10 Approach


Hole 11 (Par 4, 464 yards)

The 11th is a big two shotter that takes you back out away from the dunes.

Frankly 11 and 12 are probably two of my least favorite holes on the course – in part because the previous 5 were so good – you do feel a little bit of a let down.

Not like a #6 on Spyglass letdown, but a little bit of one.

Careful of bunkers on both the tee shot and approach.

Maidstone hole 11


Hole 12 (Par 3, 181 yards)

12 is a mid length par 3 that was easily my least favorite on the course. Bunkers on all sides, but lacks the visual interest of 8, the heroic shot of 4, and well, there’s just no comparison to 14.

Maidstone Hole 12

Hole 13 (Par 5, 500 yards)

13 re-engages you with a beautiful par 5 into the dunes which should be reachable for many people depending on the wind.

That said, there is ample trouble off the tee in the form of tall grass and bunkers, so if you aren’t feeling it – don’t be afraid to hit 3 wood.



Maidstone Hole 13

Hole 14 (Par 4, 152 yards)

Standing on the tee at 14, I didn’t want to leave. It’s one of the most special one shot holes in the world.

Not because of the history, the length, or any of that.

But simply because at that point, sitting in a remote spot deep into the dunes looking out at the oean, you’re looking at one of the most beautiful spots in golf as far as I’m concerned.

The winter of 2015 was brutally hard in the NE, and we got really lucky as Maidstone’s greens took significant damage.

I played in mid June, and this green had just been reopened a few days prior. You can still see some of the patches that got filled in if you look closely.

Once again the bunkering is phenomenal, in that it doesn’t look like there are any. It’s that seamless with the natural landscape.


Maidstone Hole 14 SeanMaidstone Hole 14 Small copy

Hole 15 (Par 5, 493 yards)

15 is another reachable par 5, but the tee shot is a bit tricky.



You have to thread the ball between large trees/bushes on both the right and left hand side about 100 yards out, then you have bunkers lining both sides of the fairway.

So a striped drive down the middle leaves you a great shot at a tap in birdie, but if you’re not careful, this hole could just as easily lead to big numbers.

Maidstone Hole 15

Hole 16 (Par 5, 485 yards)

The finishing stretch!

16 is another reachable par 5 (loving these shorter 3 shotters), and is similar to the cap number 7.

Except this time, not only do you have to clear water, but if you’re too far left you have bunkers to clear as well.



A long drive will leave you a mid iron into the green. But how gutsy do you want to be?

Maidstone Hole 16

Hole 17 (Par 4, 328 yards)

The par 4 17th is short on paper, but now features a bit of the reverse of the previous right handed cape holes we’ve seen. You can go for the green, but it’s going to take a big poke to get it there.

A solid shot between the two bunkers straight out is a good line.

The green has some undulation and is a bit tricky, especially if you end up in the bunker on the left.

Maidstone Hole 17 Approach
Approach on 17 if you hit a good drive.


Maidstone Hole 17

Hole 18 (Par 4, 390 yards)

On 18 you cross the road again and tee off towards the clubhouse to an uphill green. You’ve got bunkers on the left separating the fairway from the 1st and a big bunker on the right waiting to eat up a slice.



Once you get up to the green, you’re once again treated to a spectacular ocean view and the unfortunate realization that your round is over.

Final Thoughts on Maidstone Club

I’ve played a lot of top courses and thought “I’m so glad I played here, but man did that course wear me out.”

Both physically and mentally.

Maidstone is not one of those courses.

Before playing Maidstone, I’d read remarks that it was too short, or that technology had passed it by.

I don’t think that could be farther from the truth.

Maidstone has something that I think few courses truly master: It was a beautiful classic layout, that has very difficult elements (especially when the wind is up), but was also fun as hell to play.

You know me, my primary ranking factor for a course is fun. And because of that Maidstone creeps into my top 10 courses of all time.

I think the Maidstone experience was summed up best on a comment from a recent Instagram post of mine. @dillonmays_ said:

“There are better courses than Stone, but during any day spent there, you can be pretty confident that no one on the planet is having it better than you are.”

Couldn’t agree more, Dillon. Couldn’t agree more."
58,Maidstone,"East Hampton, NY",John Park/Willie Park Jr.,1922,Maidstone,top100golfcourses,rev58_maidstone_2,"Maidstone is routed across the Gardiner Peninsula, which is one of the finest parcels of golfing ground in the world. The Maidstone Club dates back to 1891 and we think William Tucker originally designed a basic nine-hole course. But Maidstone really came of age in the Roaring Twenties when new sandy land became available and the course was extended to 18 holes.

Willie Park Junior was the architect responsible for refashioning Maidstone and it’s a masterpiece, which is probably Park’s finest architectural ensemble. The holes to the southern end of the peninsula are ringed around by dunes, which protect the course from the Atlantic Ocean beyond. It’s a magical and almost theatrical setting.
The ground at Maidstone is often firm and fast, which can turn the 6,400-yard layout into a relatively short course. But the greens are small and tough to find and they too are firm and fast. Only the best players will wrestle par from Maidstone’s tight grip.

If you are fortunate enough to receive an invite to play Maidstone, we advise you accept. You will enjoy the game on a beautifully conditioned course which we are sure would please Willie Park Jnr if he was alive today, especially following the 2012 Coore & Crenshaw restoration, which has returned the course to its former glory. It's sheer delight.

Darius Oliver, in this edited extract from the book Planet Golf USA, writes: “Willie Park passed away shortly after Maidstone opened, and sadly he never saw the finished product. His brother John was responsible for building the course and little has changed since he had it ready for play in 1924.

While Park gets great credit for his design, the club deserves equal praise for the firm and bouncy manner in which fairways and greens are maintained. This traditional old layout is terrific fun to play and will particularly delight passionate enthusiast of Golden Age design.”"
59,Bethpage (Black),"Farmingdale, NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1935,BETHPAGE BLACK REVIEW,Graylyl Loomis,rev59_bethpage_black_1,"I played two rounds on back-to-back days on the Black course at Bethpage State Park. The course was built in 1936 by A.W. Tillinghast and, since its inception, it has hosted two U.S. Open Championships (2002, 2009) among a slew of other tournaments. Tillinghast built the course to compete with its fellow northeast neighbors (read Pine Valley and Winged Foot), and he certainly succeeded.
I played both windy rounds from the tips, measuring a long 7,400 yards. I can comfortably say that Bethpage Black is the hardest course I have ever played. Although the course was extremely difficult, it was enjoyable, and the design was fair. This quote from Golf Club Atlas sums it up well:
“Some modern courses lose a sense of continuity in their quest for difficulty. Such modern courses feel fragmented, as you go from one impossible hole to the next. One of the lasting appeals of Bethpage is that the holes seem to be effortlessly cut from the same fabric, with one sound hole following another.“
Two themes seen from A.W. Tillinghast throughout the round are a premium on driving and superb course bunkering. Keep an eye out for these two things in the pictures of the course.
The course really begins to take off on the second hole. The tee shot, seen in the picture above, requires a right to left ball flight followed by an uphill approach to an elevated green. A 3 wood or hybrid off the tee is the play. At 389 yards, it is the shortest par 4 on the course. Anything in the rough, anywhere on the course, was dead.IMG_5263
The third hole is the first real taste of Tillinghast’s amazing bunkering. The 230 yard par 3 has a large green that moves away and left from the player. A back left pin placement creates an unbelievably tough approach over the bunkers. 
The 5th hole is one of multiple on the course with a large diagonal bunker running across the fairway. The golfer can cut off as much as he wants to shorten the hole. Approaching from the right side of the fairway is optimal. The hole requires a cut off the tee and a draw into the elevated green. The par 5 4th hole is the course’s signature hole. The bunkering is extremely intimidating from the tee. Tillinghast is quoted as saying that the 4th hole is the best three shot par 5 in golf. The heavily bunkered green slopes away from the players, shrugging off any poorly struck approach shots.
The downhill approach to the 6th is one of the most picturesque on the course. The par 5 7th is another hole with a diagonal bunker guarding one side of the fairway. Cutting off a large portion of the bunker results in a shorter second shot into the hole, but land in the bunker, and you’re looking at bogey or worse. Classic risk and reward. IMG_5277The downhill par 3 8th measured 210 yards and is yet another stunning hole. The slope in front of the green is alarmingly steep. Any shot short will run back into the water. IMG_5302The collection of gorgeous par 3s continues with the 14th hole. Distance control is key with the approach to this green. The bunker short right is over ten feet deep. The tee shot can vary by nearly 40 yards depending on the pin position on this green.
The 15th hole is the number one handicap hole on the course. It is paramount to hit the fairway on this hole! A huge drive still leaves an uphill 145-165 yard approach to a heavily bunkered and sloping green. The 15th was one of my favorite holes on the course. The 17th is yet another extremely strong par 3. It requires a 205 yard shot into a very shallow green. The pin was far left during our first round and far right during our second round… I hit it into the front bunker both rounds…IMG_5361The 18th caps off a round that required nothing but pinpoint accuracy off the tee. The fairway narrows in the landing area and leaves a manageable 100-130 yard approach to a heavily bunkered, but large, elevated green. You let out of sigh of exhaustion and relief walking off the 18th green at Bethpage. 

The course was in extremely good condition. The greens, fairways, and rough were all very lush and carpet smooth; however, most of the bunkers were unraked and I ended up fixing 4-5 pitch marks on each green. Unfortunately, that is the nature of the beast with public golf courses receiving hundreds of rounds per day. The greens crew does a spectacular job with the course. I greatly enjoyed my rounds at Bethpage Black. In addition to Pine Valley, this was one of the only rounds where I couldn’t think of a weak hole on the course. I walked off the course exhausted each day. It gave me a huge appreciation for what the pros experience during a US Open at Bethpage. I was playing a less penal course setup, but each mistake during the round was deadly to a score and any weak aspect of a golfer’s game is immediately exposed. Simply having the stamina to play four competitive rounds from the tips at a monster of a course like Bethpage is a feat in itself."
60,Bethpage (Black),"Farmingdale, NY",A.W. Tillinghast,1935,"Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (Farmingdale, New York)",Bill Satterfield,rev60_bethpage_black_2,"The first thing you should expect at Bethpage Black is a high score. This is one of the best and most challenging layouts the U.S. Open (2002 and 2009) has ever featured. I mean c'mon, this course features one of the most famous signs in golf: WARNING - The Black Course Is An Extremely Difficult Course Which We Recommend Only For Highly Skilled Golfers. If that isn't a good enough reason to know what to expect then I don't know what is. The course is one of the best parkland layouts in America and features some beautiful Tillinghast bunkers, just one water hazard, long rough, and big trees. Where the Black course lets its guard down is on the greens; as a group, they have got to be the flattest greens a Top 100 course has ever boasted. The Black Course is a special track and delivers one of the few times that Joe Public can tee it up on a U.S. Open layout.

Individual Hole Analysis
Signature Hole:  4th Hole – 517 Yard Par 5 – With the trees framing this beautiful fairway that features criss-crossing bunkers and plays uphill on this double dogleg, it is no doubt that the impressive par five 4th hole at Bethpage Black is the signature hole of the course.

4th Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (517 Yard Par 5)
Best Par 3:  8th Hole – 210 Yards – and 17th - 207 Yards - I just couldn't decide which par three was better so I am featuring them both. The downhill 8th hole boasts the only water hazard at Bethpage Black in the form of a pond that sits short of the green while a lone tree on the right grabs the golfer's eye and seems to have a gravitational pull on tee shots. The 17th hole is the most bunkered green on the course and turns the putting surface into a virtual elevated island. It is an attractive and intimidating view from the tee which makes it all the more rewarding if you can walk away with a par.

Best Par 4:  5th Hole – 478 Yards – A double dogleg par four is a fairly rare treat in golf and the 5th hole at Bethpage Black is the best example I've ever played. The fairway slopes left to right while a large bunker and trees await a tee shot that travels too far to the right. A tee shot up the left side may shorten up the hole but it also will partially block the green and require a high draw into a well protected green. It is a fantastic hole with options, risks, rewards, and beauty; all of which combine to make one fine hole.

Best Par 5:  4th Hole – 517 Yards – Many critics call this hole Tillinghast's best par five design ever and I concur. The bunkering is gorgeous and the double dogleg is reachable in two but requires a pair of fantastic shots to climb the hill and find this elevated green.

4th Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (517 Yard Par 5)
Birdie Time:  2nd Hole – 389 Yard Par 4 – While the second hole can be difficult because it plays to an elevated green, it is a sub-400 yard par four that doesn't require driver off the tee and plays to a very flat green. With a green this flat there is always a good chance of dropping a putt from long distance.

2nd Hole at Bethpage State Park (Black Course) (389 Yard Par 4)
Bogey Beware:  15th Hole – 478 Yard Par 4 – This uphill dogleg left hole is tough in every sense of the word. The hole doglegs late so there is very little distance you can cut off on this long hole that features a tight fairway and the most difficult approach on the course. The green slants hard from back-left to front right and the putting surface is virtually blind from the fairway below. If you miss the fairway and find Bethpage's notorius deep rough, just pray that bogey is all the worse it will get for you."
